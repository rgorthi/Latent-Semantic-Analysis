0,"Alton Sterling’s son: ’Everyone needs to protest the right way, with peace’","The son of a Louisiana man whose father was shot and killed at   range by Baton Rouge police asked protesters for “peace” and “no violence, none whatsoever”. Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is Cameron’s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his father’s death. “I came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,” said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. “People, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. “No more arguments, violence, crimes,” said Cameron. “Yes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace  —   no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. ” Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didn’t believe all police were “bad” and that all police “shouldn’t be punished for other police’s crimes”. “The police in Dallas, Texas, they didn’t deserve that,” said Cameron. Alton Sterling’s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.

1,Shakespeare’s first four folios sell at auction for almost £2.5m,"Copies of William Shakespeare’s first four books, dubbed the “Holy Grail of publishing” have sold for almost £2. 5m at auction. Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The £2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between £800, 000 and £1. 2m. Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. “Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. ”",copi william shakespear first four book dub holi grail publish sold almost auction christi said sold separ lot wednesday bought anonym privat american collector sale london includ bard first folio wide consid import literari public english languag book publish contain play appear print fetch well estim christi book expert margaret ford said exhilar bring newli record book public attent anniversari playwright death sold along later edit publish ford said pleas result achiev sale especi sinc four book acquir privat american collector univers timeless shakespear insight human natur continu engag enthral audienc world even four centuri death play touch transform live continu read perform albania zambia
2,My grandmother’s death saved me from a life of debt,"Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmother’s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life.  My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimer’s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show  —   Jeopardy!  —   even if she wasn’t exactly sure who I was.  I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to.  I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other   jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldn’t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a   education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying Alzheimer’s disease.  I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes.  It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter  —   my mother  —   toward the end.  The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasn’t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmother’s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt.  This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmother’s “contribution”. I now work three jobs  —   one   and two    —   in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working   in a laboratory at a     dollar biomedical research institution.  The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons.

3,I feared my life lacked meaning. Cancer pushed me to find some,"It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: “I’m not the man I want to be. ” As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. I’d published a book. I’d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being “good enough” to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. I’d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, “I’ve finally broken through. ”  “I’m so proud of you,” my wife replied. “I’m so grateful you found a path that works. Let’s stick with it. ” That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about “living the right way” interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the “representative version” of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  I’ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I don’t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they won’t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, I’ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that I’ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, I’m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, what’s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a “complete response” or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, we’re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till I’m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, I’ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be.

4,"Texas man serving life sentence innocent of double murder, judge says","A central Texas man serving a life sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state judge has found. Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received   sentences and have already been released.  DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four weren’t involved in the fatal shootings of    Leslie Murphy and    Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a   opinion.  Allen’s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The state’s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the men’s claims they were innocent.  “The evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,” Kussmaul’s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco  . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three   James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years.  At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at Kussmaul’s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing.  “I was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,” Long said at the July hearing. “I had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. ”  If the court upholds the judge’s opinion and the men’s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.

5,My dad’s Reagan protests inspire me to stand up to Donald Trump,"I have been battling depression and sleeplessness while thinking about how to fight Donald Trump and what his rise means about the United States of America. It is dispiriting that after both modest and substantial gains have been made during the Obama and Black Lives Matter years (on race, gender, political imagination, LGBT rights and healthcare) many stand to be rolled back with a vengeance in the coming months and years. The retrenchment is frightening. And it’s become clear that this fight is going to last for the rest of my life. For advice on how to deal with this, I turned to my late father, Bill Thrasher. He was an air force sergeant who went to night school as an adult to become a high school and community college teacher of US and “Afro American” history. My dad died suddenly, in 2003, while teaching a class full of students a blood clot killed him instantly while he was lecturing about the civil war and the reconstruction. His sudden death broke my heart, but he left me with a road map: the example of a civil rights life well lived, a binder of newspaper clippings from a column he wrote in our local newspaper, and a single audio recording of a monthly radio show in Ventura, California, he hosted called Minority Perspective. That sole episode I have was broadcast on 7 December 1986. It was Pearl Harbor day, and the height of Reagan’s   affair. In it, Dad laments his sadness after the previous month’s election, when California voters   a deeply conservative governor. Here’s a passage which gave me life after Trump was elected:  Conservatism, by its nature, is racism. It’s racism only because conservatism simply means to conserve, to preserve the status quo. And the status quo with respect to minorities, is: “Stay in your place! Remain the same, exactly where you’re at. Be the victims of discrimination! Do not protest. Let the laws stand as they are. Do not enact laws that will try to redress grievances. ” So when the county of Ventura, the state of California, and the United States of America votes to support conservative candidates who represent those viewpoints, it is saying to us, the minorities: “It’s gone too far! You must stay in your place. There will be no more change. You must continue wherever you are at. You will always be on the low end of the pole economically and politically. ” And that is why it is so difficult for Afro Americans to accept the conservatives, no matter who they happen to be, whether they are in the Republican party or the Democratic party. Because conservatism, by its very nature, is racist! It’s  . It’s   American. It’s  . It’s   American. It’s   American. It’s   that isn’t white, Anglo Saxon, Protestant male. Because that group wants to preserve what it has illegally gained and wishes to continue  —   in politics, and in economics. And it will use the political institution to keep their gains, even though they weren’t gained honestly or legally. That’s my objection to conservatism. Conservatism will prevent my children and my grandchildren from fulfilling their destiny as Americans. My children and my grandchildren, as well as I am, as well my father and my grandfather and my   were   citizens and are   citizens, and conservatism wants to keep us as   citizens.  I am not going to accept that! I will spend all of my energies fighting that type of thought, and I urge all minorities  —   not just Afro Americans, but all minorities  —   to resist this. We have to do whatever we can, everywhere, wherever we’re at, in whatever capacity we’re in, to keep the issue alive  —   to keep pushing, to keep probing, to keep challenging, until we have forged our way into the economic and political system, where we have a control our of destiny, and not have to leave it in control of people who are antagonistic toward us, who hate us, who do not want to see us have a share in the American dream. Listening to my father fighting Reaganism, 30 years ago next week, is both depressing and freeing as I think about fighting Trumpism. I feel depressed that the same issues he fought remain so present some three decades later  —   issues that won’t be solved in my lifetime. But I also feel less alone in knowing that I am connected to him  —   and to my ancestors and nieces and nephews  —   in an intergenerational struggle for a better America. Even if the fight doesn’t end with me, I hope to ease the path for those who follow, or at least give the comfort that my father’s words lend me today.  Trump and his ilk will try to say “stay in your place” to all of us who aren’t conservative white men accommodationist white liberals will do so, as well.  Fortunately, I know where (and who) I come from, and I can listen to my dad pushing back on Reaganism to guide me when I feel lost in Trumpland. If you, too, are feeling down about the fight ahead, don’t be afraid to ask your elders for guidance. They might just show the way towards the   road just when you need it most.

6,Flatmates of gay Syrian refugee beheaded in Turkey fear they will be next,"Three flatmates of a gay Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic attack in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days since his murder. Wisam Sankari, a hospital cleaner, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in Istanbul. His body was found two days later in a nearby area of Istanbul, his head severed and his battered body only identifiable to his friends by his clothing. A week on, three of his flatmates say they fear being murdered in the same fashion after receiving warnings that the man Sankari met on 25 July wants to kill them too. “There have been people in the street and people on the phone, who said: ‘He will get you next,’” said one of Sankari’s friends, a chef who, like his flatmates, asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “There was also a voice message on Facebook. ” In an interview with the Guardian in Sankari’s former room, a cramped lodging he shared with five other people, his friends said he had been in fear during the last months of his life after Turkish officials, UN diplomats and charity workers had proved unable to protect him following a series of homophobic attacks. A Greek appeals board said in June that it considers Turkey safe enough for gay Syrians to be deported to as part of the controversial   migration deal. But Sankari’s friends say his experiences show how dangerous the country is for gay refugees, and unstable for refugees in general. They alleged that in the months before his death, Sankari had: “Do you call this safe?” summarised a second of Sankari’s flatmates, as they listened to their friend’s favourite song and watched a video made in his honour. “We don’t have an organisation to protect us. We want everyone in Europe to understand our situation here for Syrians, especially gays. We’re suffering. ” This was the third brutal attack Sankari had experienced, the flatmate continued. “Five months ago, he was attacked and his head was cut,” he said. “He went to the police, but they didn’t help him. [Another time] he was put in a car and he had to throw himself from it [to survive]. ” Then at 12. 20am on 25 July, he got a call from a Syrian who had recently arrived in Istanbul. “He went to see him, and he never came back. Two days later we heard he was dead. ” Sankari’s murder was one of at least 20 homophobic attacks on Syrian refugees in the past six months, according to an activist who is documenting such incidents. “Turkey is not a safe place, it’s not a   place,” said Hossam, a Syrian who organises a weekly support session for gay refugees in Istanbul, and who asked to be identified only by his first name. “And with the political situation in the country, it’s not getting better. ” More generally, Sankari’s friends said many of his other experiences showed how vulnerable life is for refugees of any sexuality in Turkey. Despite recent legislative changes, the vast majority of the 2. 7 million Syrians in Turkey have no realistic chance of accessing the legal labour market, forcing them to work illegally in exploitative conditions that contravene the UN refugee convention. Sankari was one such case. His latest employers paid him about half the Turkish minimum wage (600 Turkish lira, or £150) for a hospital cleaning job that saw him work seven days a week. If he complained, he risked being fired during previous employment as a waiter at a cafe, he was sacked for asking for time off to recover from illness. “We’re working as animals,” said one of Sankari’s friends, a literature graduate who was a teacher in Syria but now works as a waiter in Turkey. “No one is working at what they studied for. We work here   hours a day. We don’t have a weekend. The Turks want us to work and work and work  —   without money or rights. ” Sankari’s battles with Turkish bureaucracy also highlight the basic logistical challenges Syrians face on a daily basis in Turkey. Sankari struggled to access support from aid groups and officials in Istanbul because he had first registered with the Turkish government in Hatay, a city near the country’s southern borders.  To apply for resettlement in the west, or to secure even basic support from   NGOs, Sankari needed to return to Hatay. But he was scared to do so because of threats he had faced while briefly living there, said Hossam, who had met Sankari at his weekly   session. “He was desperately seeking help but he couldn’t reach anyone,” said Hossam. It is a depressingly familiar situation, the activist added. “During my time with the group, I’ve witnessed a lot of serious threats, a lot of hate crimes, people who have experienced incidents that didn’t necessarily end their life, but [involved] beatings, rape and abuse,” said Hossam. “And those people couldn’t reach places where they felt safe and secure. They had to deal with this on their own. ”  A senior government official said: “We are unable to independently verify the claim that the victim’s plea for assistance was ignored by law enforcement. Obviously, this barbaric attack doesn’t reflect the way Syrian refugees are treated in Turkey, which is the largest host of refugees in the world. We are investigating this incident and will take all necessary steps to bring perpetrators to justice. ” In a statement, the UN refugee agency said it was working to resettle LGBTI refugees currently living in Turkey, and expressed sadness about Sankari’s death.

7,Jaffas and daredevils: life on the world’s steepest street,", Most people take 10 minutes to climb the world’s steepest residential street. But Bindi Bezar, who works in a   gift shop near the bottom, does it in seven. “I have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,” said Bezar. Baldwin Street, located on the north face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming. Since being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for its exhausting 1:3 gradient, it has enjoyed local interest. But now Dunedin is a stopping point for international cruise ships, the street has become the top tourist destination in New Zealand’s oldest city.  In the busy season between October and February, hundreds of tourists visit the street each day, starting at 6am and often continuing until dark  —   which in the summer can be 11pm.  It has also become a hot spot for daredevil sports enthusiasts   who trike, bike and slide down the slope in anything with wheels.  In response, a host of entrepreneurial residents have opened gift shops and food outlets  —   with more permanent infrastructure such as public toilets potentially on the horizon.  Beverley McClay has lived on the street for nine years, and delights in the growing popularity of her home. From her porch, she often watches strangers open her gate, potter around her garden, and occasionally  —   and most unwelcomely  —   relieve themselves in her Corokia hedge.  “I think a lot of tourists don’t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,” she laughs.  “It’s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing grown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing. ” McClay, who lives alone, says the street’s fame has stopped her from becoming lonely as the years go by.  “It makes me feel like I am part of a community here, there’s always someone just outside my door. ” In the past year Baldwin Street has also become a   destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers  —   especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow. However, to McClay’s disappointment, people are now tending to drive to the top of the street instead of walking, and preferring to use selfie sticks rather than asking residents to take their picture.  On Friday, the street was crammed with an estimated 15, 000 people for the annual Jaffa race, in which 75, 000 chocolate balls were rolled down the hill. “It’s my busiest day of the year,” said Bezar, who has become particularly fond of the visiting ship’s captains, whose drinks she always serves first.  “I know it’s just a street, but most of the residents here are so friendly, it’s also become a really good way to have a chat to a Kiwi. And  —   it’s free. ”",most peopl take minut climb world steepest residenti street bindi bezar work gift shop near bottom seven angina climb step cheaper go said bezar baldwin street locat north face signal hill dunedin zealand boom sinc list guin book record exhaust gradient enjoy local interest dunedin stop point intern cruis ship street becom tourist destin zealand oldest citi busi season octob februari hundr tourist visit street start often continu dark summer also becom spot daredevil sport enthusiast trike bike slide slope anyth wheel respons host entrepreneuri resid open gift shop food outlet perman infrastructur public toilet potenti horizon beverley mcclay live street nine year delight grow popular home from porch often watch stranger open gate potter around garden occasion unwelcom reliev corokia hedg think tourist know real street peopl actual live laugh social busi often come dress grown meet peopl tourist like watch stack wood mcclay live alon say street fame stop becom lone year make feel like part commun alway someon outsid door past year baldwin street also becom destin unusu social media trend snap pictur angl creat optic illus hous sever lopsid trend significantli increas visitor number especi winter season tourist usual avoid area frost occasion snow howev mcclay disappoint peopl tend drive street instead walk prefer selfi stick rather ask resid take pictur friday street cram estim peopl annual jaffa race chocol ball roll hill busiest year said bezar becom particularli fond visit ship captain whose drink alway serv first know street resid friendli also becom realli good chat kiwi free
8,NSA contractor arrested for alleged theft of top secret classified information,"The FBI has arrested a National Security Agency contractor on suspicion of the theft of top secret classified data and documents in an alleged security breach at the same intelligence agency whose spy secrets were exposed by Edward Snowden. Disclosure of the documents stolen “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” claimed the justice department in a press release giving details of the criminal complaint against Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland. He was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor, and, it emerged on Wednesday, has been in detention since a court appearance on 29 August.  Details of the arrest were first reported by the New York Times, which suggested the breach involved the possible theft of highly classified computer code developed to hack into the networks of foreign governments. “There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country,” said Martin’s attorneys Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman in a statement, according to the Washington Post. “What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court. ” They said the charges against Martin were “mere allegations” and they had not yet seen prosecutors’ evidence.  The justice department confirmed that Martin worked for the same company as Snowden when he exposed details of NSA mass surveillance methods three years ago. Martin has been in custody since a court appearance in August. According to the New York Times, Martin is suspected of taking the “source code” developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.  Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia, facing charges under the Espionage Act, reacted to the details of the arrest, tweeting to his 2. 4 million followers: “This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?” The White House said Barack Obama took the national security implications seriously. Press secretary Josh Earnest told a briefing: “I think any time that information like this is released in the context of a criminal complaint, the federal government is reminded of how important is it to be vigilant about protecting the national security of the country and information that is relevant to our national security. “So this is certainly a situation that the Department of Justice takes seriously, as evidenced by their complaint, but this is a situation that President Obama takes quite seriously, and it is a good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important is it for us to protect sensitive national security information. ” The justice department confirmed: “A criminal complaint has been filed charging Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor. ” The assistant attorney general for national security, John Carlin, US attorney Rod Rosenstein for the District of Maryland and special agent in charge Gordon Johnson of the FBI’s Baltimore field office made the announcement. According to the affidavit, Martin was a contractor with the federal government and had a top secret national security clearance. He was arrested late on 27 August as search warrants were executed at his home, two storage sheds and his vehicle on a leafy suburban street outside of Baltimore. “I heard a boom and went to the ground,” Dave Cunningham, who lives a couple of doors down from Martin and described himself as a “lifer” in the neighborhood, said of the raid on Martin’s home. He said he thought it was a gunshot. But when he looked out the window, he saw numerous law enforcement vehicles, including two large vans that parked in front of the house. Glen Bond, who has lived in a house across the street from Bond for 50 years, said there were two big vans in front of the house blocking it from view and “25 or 30 cars”. “They were in camouflaged uniforms, two dozen of them. They were serious. Helmets, rifles,” Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said. “Big guns,” Bond said. “When they came they took out a whole bunch of stuff but it was all in black trash bags. You couldn’t see anything. ” A woman who came to the door of Martin’s home said: “This is a matter that’s under investigation. I have no comment . .. I’d appreciate it if you’d leave from the front of my house so my dogs will calm down and I can get some peace. ” Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with  —   no one could say whether they were married  —   as “nice” “decent” and “peaceful”. During execution of the warrants, investigators found   documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media. “A large percentage of the materials recovered from Martin’s residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were property of the US government and contained highly classified information, including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1, 000, which Martin allegedly stole,” a justice department press statement said. Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014. “These documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues. The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities,” the justice department said. The documents have been reviewed by a government agency and designated as top secret, “meaning that unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” the justice department statement said. If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained. The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both. The NSA said in the wake of the Snowden revelations in 2013 it had tightened up internal security, introducing more stringent monitoring of staff and a   system in which sensitive information needed two people to access it rather than just one. Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers. The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records. Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man. They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance. It was not yet clear what motivated the latest alleged leaker. Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at the Guardian in 2013 when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA. As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China. Flying from Hawaii, where he was based, to Hong Kong, he gave tens of thousands of top secret documents to journalists to illustrate the scale of surveillance by the NSA and Britain’s GCHQ. The documents also revealed the extent to which major US tech companies were cooperating with the NSA in providing details from customer accounts. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who was given material by Snowden, rounded on the NSA for its lack of security. “Nobody is more inept at securing its own data than NSA. But trust them to keep all yours safe and secure. ” Jesselyn Radack, a US lawyer who represents whistleblowers, was among those quick to caution journalists about making comparisons with Snowden. In a tweet, she wrote: “Mediapls stop comparing theft of NSA source code to @Snowden blowing whistle on secret domestic surveillance. ”",arrest nation secur agenc contractor suspicion theft secret

9,Donald Trump to dissolve his charitable foundation after mounting complaints,"Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the  ’s charitable and business interests. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be “dissolved” to avoid “even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President”. Trump said he would continue to pursue his “strong interest in philanthropy” in other ways. The closure of the Trump Foundation, which was first reported by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney general’s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and issued a cease and desist order to it in October. The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold. Trump reportedly used $258, 000 of the foundation’s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The   has since paid $2, 500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation. Trump had not donated to his own foundation since 2008 the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration. The decision also comes as Trump’s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether people were paying for access to the incoming president and his family.  A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trump’s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers. Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, reportedly promised the opportunity to meet the   in exchange for $1m in donations. These issues have come as Trump’s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trump’s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding “an office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state”. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trump’s new hotel in Washington. The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the   has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump owes $364m to Deutsche Bank. A news conference that the   promised to hold on the topic on 15 December has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017.",donald trump announc saturday shut charit foundat respons mount complaint conflict relat charit busi interest statement releas campaign trump said donald trump foundat would dissolv avoid even appear conflict role presid trump said would continu pursu strong interest philanthropi way closur trump foundat first report york time requir approv york attorney gener offic current investig nonprofit issu ceas desist order octob donald trump foundat repeatedli subject controversi throughout presidenti campaign seri investig washington post david fahrenthold trump reportedli use foundat money person legal settlement also spent charit fund multipl portrait footbal helmet autograph heisman trophi winner tebow foundat also made donat polit group support florida attorney gener bondi longtim trump backer violat sinc paid intern revenu servic donat trump donat foundat sinc nonprofit reli donat trump associ includ profession wrestl magnat vinc linda mcmahon gave trump foundat linda mcmahon sinc announc trump nomine lead small busi administr decis also come trump children scrutini charit effort rais question whether peopl pay access incom presid famili celebr auction coffe date ivanka trump sponsor eric trump chariti call earlier decemb donor appar given attempt curri favor incom presid access closest advis both eric brother also schedul appear recept behalf conserv chariti weekend inaugur recept sinc cancel reportedli promis opportun meet exchang donat these issu come trump entir real estat busi come scrutini potenti conflict interest particular trump intern properti potenti violat emolu claus constitut prohibit anyon hold offic profit trust accept present emolu offic titl kind whatev king princ foreign state conflict also appli domest kuwaiti govern alreadi announc shift annual parti februari trump hotel washington issu amplifi trump organ privat held corpor flout longstand tradit releas return result clear know asset liabil trump known though trump owe deutsch bank news confer promis hold topic decemb sinc postpon sometim januari
10,Serbian Olympic rowers sink in ferocious conditions on Rio waters,"Most Olympic rowers have spent months fretting and prepping about the dangers of   mosquitos and adenoviruses lurking in the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas. Few, though, were ready to face vicious crosswinds and waters so choppy that it left a Serbian boat capsized and others claiming these were the worst conditions they had ever encountered. Matt Smith, the executive director of rowing’s governing body, Fisa, defended the decision not to postpone racing  —   but warned rowers that conditions were likely to get even worse on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, which could even lead to rounds being cancelled. “It’s a small regatta, with 550 rowers, so we can pretty easily make up one day,” he said. “But if we get two or three knocked out then we go into contingency mode, and into scenarios where we possible drop rounds. We told team managers on Thursday that if you lose rounds of racing, your results from previous races could determine your placement in finals or  . They are on notice that every race matters because if we lose two or three days’ racing it could be the case. ” Smith was speaking after loud complaints about racing on the opening day being allowed to go ahead, despite the weather, which led to several rowers nearly capsizing before the Serbian men’s pair of Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik went into the water when their boat caught a crab. Usually rowers have to finish the course to be allowed to race again in the repechage. Fisa, however, ruled that because of the conditions and the fact they were behind in the schedule, the rowers could take a DNF  —   did not finish  —   and still compete in the repechage on Sunday at 9. 30am. Fisa also denied that the Serbians faced any dangers from falling into the water. “It is nearly drinking water,” Smith said. “It’s swimming quality. It’s really good. Some might say there are viruses there, but it’s amazingly good right now. ” Most rowers did not take such a rosy view. The Australian Kim Brennan, a competitor in single sculls, was a particularly vociferous critic, insisting the course was “not rowable”. “I do think it should have been called off,” she said. “And speaking to a lot of rowers in the boat park there’s a lot of discontent. We’ve put 10 years plus into this and to have it decided on a little bit of lottery, and what waves hit a boat at a particular time, is a little bit disappointing. ” Every race had its dramas that went beyond seeing who would cross the line first. At one point, the American sculler Genevra Stone nearly sunk like, well, a stone. While the Egyptian sculler Nadia Negm reckoned the conditions were the worst in which she had rowed. “I actually thought I was going to sink it was so rough,” Negm said. “At one point, just past 1, 000m, there were these huge waves and a full one came right into my boat and the water was up to my seat. I was 100% sure I was going to sink, and then another wave came up and I just stopped and froze. Thank God I didn’t go under. It’s the toughest conditions I have ever rowed in. It was really intense. I wish the rest of the racers good luck  —   if you are rowing this week you better know how to swim. ” Meanwhile, the Irish sculler Sanita Puspure, who finished one place ahead of Negm in second, described the conditions as “horrific”. She said: “It was like sailing, surfing, everything all in one and a bit of rowing in the end. I was just thrown around with the wind. I couldn’t get the blades in at the same time. At one stage I was blown parallel to the racing lane so I had to tack with one arm into the lane, which is probably unseen before  —   a person doing   rowing during a race. I was pretty helpless. ” But Britain’s Kath Grainger  —   who, along with her partner, Vicky Thornley, qualified for the double sculls semi‑finals by finishing second in her heat  —   disagreed. While saying that it was “the worst Olympic conditions I have raced in” she felt it was right to race on. “If the regatta runs you have to race in whatever the conditions are,” she insisted. The British sculler Alan Campbell, who looked particularly impressive in winning his heat, claimed the conditions reminded him of coastal rowing. He said: “I thought I must be losing time and I looked around and there was a blade in the air and one down there. ” “The wind comes down from the mountain,” he added, pointing to the most famous landmark on the Rio skyline. “Christ The Redeemer needs to spread his arms out a little more. ”",most olymp rower spent month fret prep danger mosquito adenovirus lurk lagoa rodrigo freita though readi face viciou crosswind water choppi left serbian boat capsiz other claim worst condit ever encount matt smith execut director row govern bodi fisa defend decis postpon race warn rower condit like even wors sunday monday tuesday could even lead round cancel small regatta rower pretti easili make said three knock conting mode scenario possibl drop round told team manag thursday lose round race result previou race could determin placement final they notic everi race matter lose three day race could case smith speak loud complaint race open allow ahead despit weather sever rower nearli capsiz serbian pair milo vasic nenad bedik went water boat caught crab usual rower finish cours allow race repechag fisa howev rule condit fact behind schedul rower could take finish still compet repechag sunday fisa also deni serbian face danger fall water nearli drink water smith said swim qualiti realli good some might virus amazingli good right most rower take rosi view australian brennan competitor singl scull particularli vocifer critic insist cours rowabl think call said speak rower boat park discont year plu decid littl lotteri wave boat particular time littl disappoint everi race drama went beyond see would cross line first point american sculler genevra stone nearli sunk like well stone while egyptian sculler nadia negm reckon condit worst row actual thought go sink rough negm said point past huge wave full came right boat water seat sure go sink anoth wave came stop froze thank toughest condit ever row realli intens wish rest racer good luck row week better know swim meanwhil irish sculler sanita puspur finish place ahead negm second describ condit horrif said like sail surf everyth row thrown around wind blade time stage blown parallel race lane tack lane probabl unseen person row race pretti helpless britain kath grainger along partner vicki thornley qualifi doubl scull semi final finish second heat disagre while say worst olymp condit race felt right race regatta run race whatev condit insist british sculler alan campbel look particularli impress win heat claim condit remind coastal row said thought must lose time look around blade wind come mountain ad point famou landmark skylin christ redeem need spread arm littl
11,The strange case of Pamela Anderson’s news-hogging vegan sandwich,"Name: Pamela Anderson. Age: 49. Occupation: Definitely not Julian Assange’s murderer. You stated that a little too confidently for my liking. It’s true, though. Anderson absolutely didn’t murder Assange with a Pret vegan sandwich on Saturday. Not even a bit. I mean, by those standards, neither did I. But Anderson really didn’t. Can we track this back to the beginning for a second? Sure. On Saturday, Anderson visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret. And he remained staunchly unmurdered. I’m so confused. Was she supposed to murder him? No, not at all. But he went quiet after the visit, and rumours began to swirl that he was dead from Anderson’s bready hand. Is this real life? Did this actually happen? Yes, and it was exacerbated when Wikileaks began tweeting things such as “  1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809” which some people read as a dead man’s switch to be activated in the event of Assange’s death. But he’s definitely alive? Well, he might be. After hearing about this, someone on Twitter wrote: “Don’t trust unconfirmed reports of Assange being alive. The Clinton machine is capable of body doubles. ARREST PAMELA ANDERSON NOW #MAGA. ” So who knows? Wait, Hillary Clinton is in on this, too? No. God, I hate 2016 so much. Has Anderson actually said anything about this? Yes, after the visit she said: “I really believe in him and think he’s a good person, and I’m concerned about his health, his family, and I just hope that by some miracle he’s set free. ” And she tried to fix his ailing health with a vegan sandwich? An unpoisoned vegan sandwich, remember. There’s a big distinction. Was she in the UK just to meet Assange? No, she also delivered a lecture to the Oxford Union about the dangers of porn addiction. Oh wow, that sounds interesting. Sorry, I’m too busy talking about the bigger story  —   you know, how she bought a sandwich for a man and he didn’t immediately die from it.

12,‘Voting for a racist’: Trump enters key debate fresh from pivot that wasn’t,"From the moment in May when Donald Trump all but sealed the Republican presidential nomination, he has been faced with a nagging question: when will he pivot? When would a new Trump emerge  —   a candidate able to appeal to more than the angry base who propelled him to primary victory over much more seasoned politicians? In the Republican establishment, the wait for the pivot began after Trump forced his remaining opponents out of the race, in Indiana four months ago. It continued through the convention in Cleveland in July. Once he had been formally nominated, the thinking went, maybe then the pivot would come. It didn’t. On Monday, the first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton takes place, at Hofstra University in New York. As Trump prepares to face the largest audience of the cycle thus far, the fabled pivot is nowhere in sight.  Urged by those who reluctantly embraced him to tone down his rhetoric, Trump has in recent weeks attempted to show he is capable of discipline. After doing without teleprompters for much of the primary, he turned to reading from scripts written by advisers brought in to save a sinking campaign. He also embarked on an “outreach” effort aimed at some minority communities, suddenly incorporating into his stump speech lines about the plight of African American voters. But Trump’s platform, his slate of signature policies, chief among them his   line on immigration, has remained exactly the same. And at the debate, some opposed to Trump worry, such details may be lost. Behind a podium, on primetime TV, appearance and style, not policy, often dictate who wins and who loses. “The fact that his base, even his ardent white nationalist supporters, are not complaining about his message pivots is a clear sign that his policies remain substantively the same,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration reform advocacy group America’s Voice. On immigration, Sharry said, Trump hinted for weeks at a “softening”  —   and secured commensurate media coverage. Then he delivered a speech in Phoenix that “doubled down on his radical proposals” such as deporting the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants who live in America today. “That’s not a policy pivot, it’s a Kellyanne   messaging pivot,” Sharry said, referring to the Republican pollster hired in August as Trump’s campaign manager. “The idea was to make it sound like he was ‘softening’ in hopes of bringing home suburban voters, mostly women, who are uncomfortable voting for a racist. ” A similar tactic was employed regarding Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslim immigration, which was widely criticized even among Republican elected officials. Trump rebranded the plan as “extreme vetting” rooted in an ideological test, but when asked directly plainly denied he was walking back the Muslim ban and said he was in fact strengthening it. Last week, Donald Trump Jr once more revealed the campaign’s thinking, tweeting a photo of a bowl of Skittles as a metaphor for refugees from Syria. If a few were poisoned and could kill you, he asked, would you want any at all? Trump’s first television ad, released last month, depicted immigrants streaming across the border. The commercial claimed that under a Clinton presidency, “Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crime get to stay  —   collecting social security benefits, skipping the line. ” Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist and leader of the Never Trump movement, made a similar assessment to Sharry’s. If there had been any strategic change from the Trump campaign, he said, it was only done to find ways for the nominee to mollify undecided voters uncomfortable with his comments about Latinos, Muslims and other demographics. “There’s been no real pivot on immigration and there’s been no real pivot that he has any desire to communicate with Hispanic voters,” said Wilson, who also cited Trump’s efforts to discuss the concerns of black voters. “Donald Trump can give a hot damn about African Americans, but he comes out and says, ‘I want to help inner cities,’” he said. “That’s not really about African American voters, but about white suburban voters. ” While Trump has discussed the challenges facing the African American community, he has largely done so in the company of his own supporters or in the comfortable confines of Fox News.  When he did travel to Flint, Michigan, the site of a crisis over water poisoned by lead, Trump praised the executives implicated in the scandal and criticized a black pastor who interrupted him when he made a political speech at a predominantly black church. Last week, Trump made headlines for saying African Americans were in their “worst shape ever” an echo of his claim that black voters have nothing left to lose, because they lack jobs and education and are disproportionately affected by crime, and should therefore vote for him. “He’s a crafty enough salesman and a crafty enough conman to know that he cannot confuse the object with the subject,” said Wilson. There may be no pivot, but the strategy of appearing to make one, to some of the people some of the time, is paying electoral dividends. Despite there being no indication that minority voters will turn out in the Republican’s favor, polling has tightened. In Philadelphia recently, Stacye Mccollum braved the late summer heat to watch Barack Obama stump for Clinton. An African American voter from Manayunk, Pennsylvania, she stood a dozen steps away from the first black president. Trump’s latest   “pivot” had not gone unnoticed. Referencing “the one comment he had made [about how] ‘I don’t understand why African Americans are voting for Democrats, because Democrats haven’t do[ne] you well. You have no job, you’re low poverty” Mccollum said she had taken only one thing away from Trump’s version of outreach. “I found him to be very condescending,” she said.",from moment donald trump seal republican presidenti nomin face nag question pivot when would trump emerg candid abl appeal angri base propel primari victori much season politician republican establish wait pivot began trump forc remain oppon race indiana four month continu convent cleveland juli onc formal nomin think went mayb pivot would come monday first presidenti debat hillari clinton take place hofstra univers york trump prepar face largest audienc cycl thu fabl pivot nowher sight urg reluctantli embrac tone rhetor trump recent week attempt show capabl disciplin after without teleprompt much primari turn read script written advis brought save sink campaign also embark outreach effort aim minor commun suddenli incorpor stump speech line plight african american voter trump platform slate signatur polici chief among line immigr remain exactli debat oppos trump worri detail lost behind podium primetim appear style polici often dictat win lose fact base even ardent white nationalist support complain messag pivot clear sign polici remain substant said frank sharri execut director immigr reform advocaci group america voic immigr sharri said trump hint week soften secur commensur media coverag then deliv speech phoenix doubl radic propos deport roughli million undocu migrant live america today that polici pivot kellyann messag pivot sharri said refer republican pollster hire august trump campaign manag idea make sound like soften hope bring home suburban voter mostli women uncomfort vote racist similar tactic employ regard trump propos muslim immigr wide critic even among republican elect offici trump rebrand plan extrem vet root ideolog test ask directli plainli deni walk back muslim said fact strengthen last week donald trump reveal campaign think tweet photo bowl skittl metaphor refuge syria poison could kill ask would want trump first televis releas last month depict immigr stream across border commerci claim clinton presid syrian refuge flood illeg immigr convict commit crime stay collect social secur benefit skip line rick wilson republican strategist leader never trump movement made similar assess sharri strateg chang trump campaign said done find way nomine mollifi undecid voter uncomfort comment latino muslim demograph there real pivot immigr real pivot desir commun hispan voter said wilson also cite trump effort discuss concern black voter donald trump give damn african american come say want help inner citi said that realli african american voter white suburban voter while trump discuss challeng face african american commun larg done compani support comfort confin new when travel flint michigan site crisi water poison lead trump prais execut implic scandal critic black pastor interrupt made polit speech predominantli black church last week trump made headlin say african american worst shape ever echo claim black voter noth left lose lack job educ disproportion affect crime therefor vote crafti enough salesman crafti enough conman know cannot confus object subject said wilson there pivot strategi appear make peopl time pay elector dividend despit indic minor voter turn republican favor poll tighten philadelphia recent stacy mccollum brave late summer heat watch barack obama stump clinton african american voter manayunk pennsylvania stood dozen step away first black presid trump latest pivot gone unnot referenc comment made understand african american vote democrat democrat well poverti mccollum said taken thing away trump version outreach found condescend said
13,Push for ban on domestic ivory trade spurs feud at international summit,"A resolution to end the domestic trade in ivory has descended into acrimony at a major conservation summit, with a handful of countries, including Japan and South Africa, objecting to the proposed ban. A coalition of countries, including the US, France, Gabon, Kenya and Malawi, spoke in favor of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) motion that calls for every country to ban their internal trade of ivory.  However, delegates from Japan, Namibia and South Africa argued that domestic ivory markets should be left open as long as they are regulated. Canada voiced concerns that the ivory ban would affect trade of walrus and narwhal, which are hunted by indigenous people in the country.  South Africa and Namibia even threatened to end their membership of IUCN over the wording of the motion, according to sources at the world conservation congress, which is being held in Hawaii. After two days of deadlocked talks, the resolution will be discussed further on Saturday in a bid to find consensus. The intransigence of some countries has enraged environmental groups that make up the bulk of the IUCN’s   membership, which also includes 217 state and national government agencies.  “It is disappointing that we are now told we have to meet again for a contact group [a negotiating session] since a few members were not pleased with the outcome of previous discussions,” said Sue Lieberman,   of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a cosponsor of the motion. “There’s truly a crisis for elephants and we need to close the elephant ivory markets. The overwhelming majority of the earlier contact group wanted to close domestic ivory markets. ” Danny Auron, campaign director at Avaaz, similarly expressed frustration. “Every 15 minutes an elephant is slaughtered for its tusks, and at this rate they’ll be gone forever in a few short years,” he said. “If we want this species to survive, governments need to be falling over themselves to strengthen protections, not fighting to water them down. ” While the IUCN does not regulate the ivory trade, it is hoped that a resolution calling for the end of domestic markets will help spur nations to commit to a ban at the Cites convention, held in Johannesburg later this month. It is through the Cites treaty that the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989. John Scanlon,   of Cites, told the Guardian the forthcoming convention “is without doubt one of the most critical meetings of Cites in its   history.  “It is clear that this [IUCN] motion is generating an intense and robust debate amongst the membership of IUCN, with differing views being strongly expressed. ” The IUCN resolution calls on governments around the world to “close their domestic markets for elephant ivory as a matter of urgency”. The motion states that IUCN members are “deeply concerned” by the illegal killing of elephants that threatens the species’ survival, harms national security and undermines sustainable economic development in countries where elephants are found in the wild. Millions of elephants once roamed throughout Africa and from the coast of Persia through India and deep into China. Habitat loss and rampant poaching has drastically reduced this number, with African elephants now being killed at a faster rate than they are reproducing. The first ever   census of Africa’s savannah elephants found that nearly a third were wiped out between 2007 and 2014. Poachers target the animals to supply ivory from their tusks in Asia. Gangs can get $1, 100 per kilogram for ivory in China, which announced last year it would shut down its own domestic market.  Ivory can also be found by buyers in many western countries. A recent report by the NGO Traffic found that the antiques ivory market in the UK appeared to have declined significantly, though there are still thousands of ivory items on sale in London’s markets. Even though the international trade in ivory has been banned for more than 25 years, a flourishing black market has led to the slaughter of elephants, as well as the people charged with protecting them. A separate IUCN motion to protect 30% of the world’s oceans was agreed with little dispute. The resolution, if adopted by countries, would drastically increase the small amount of marine area currently off limits to commercial fishing and drilling. A related motion that supports marine protected areas on the high seas, which are beyond national jurisdiction, also passed.  “These motions will help reverse the tide of habitat destruction, pollution and depletion of the world’s oceans,” said Francine Kershaw, a science fellow with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Both emphasize the need for more marine protected areas, which are scientifically supported to enhance ocean health and resilience in the face of global warming, ocean acidification and rapidly escalating industrial activities. ”  Dr Lance Morgan, president of the Marine Conservation Institute, also praised the motions. “This is terrific news and will surely create momentum for establishing more marine reserves around the world in coming years,” he said. “We know how to fix the oceans but now we need the political will and public support to make hard decisions before it’s too late. ” More than 80 other resolutions passed with little fuss. They include a call for a ban on gillnet fishing, which threatens the vaquita porpoise in Mexico, and restrictions on the trade of pangolins. Other motions backed the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency by countries. Voting was conducted online prior to the IUCN congress.",resolut domest trade ivori descend acrimoni major conserv summit hand countri includ japan south africa object propos coalit countri includ franc gabon kenya malawi spoke favor intern union conserv natur iucn motion call everi countri intern trade ivori howev deleg japan namibia south africa argu domest ivori market left open long regul canada voic concern ivori would affect trade walru narwhal hunt indigen peopl countri south africa namibia even threaten membership iucn word motion accord sourc world conserv congress held hawaii after day deadlock talk resolut discuss saturday find consensu intransig countri enrag environment group make bulk iucn membership also includ state nation govern agenc disappoint told meet contact group negoti session sinc member pleas outcom previou discuss said lieberman intern polici wildlif conserv societi cosponsor motion there truli crisi eleph need close eleph ivori market overwhelm major earlier contact group want close domest ivori market danni auron campaign director avaaz similarli express frustrat everi minut eleph slaughter tusk rate gone forev short year said want speci surviv govern need fall strengthen protect fight water while iucn regul ivori trade hope resolut call domest market help spur nation commit cite convent held johannesburg later month cite treati intern trade ivori ban john scanlon cite told guardian forthcom convent without doubt critic meet cite histori clear iucn motion gener intens robust debat amongst membership iucn differ view strongli express iucn resolut call govern around world close domest market eleph ivori matter urgenc motion state iucn member deepli concern illeg kill eleph threaten speci surviv harm nation secur undermin sustain econom develop countri eleph found wild million eleph roam throughout africa coast persia india deep china habitat loss rampant poach drastic reduc number african eleph kill faster rate reproduc first ever censu africa savannah eleph found nearli third wipe poacher target anim suppli ivori tusk asia gang kilogram ivori china announc last year would shut domest market ivori also found buyer mani western countri recent report traffic found antiqu ivori market appear declin significantli though still thousand ivori item sale london market even though intern trade ivori ban year flourish black market slaughter eleph well peopl charg protect separ iucn motion protect world ocean agre littl disput resolut adopt countri would drastic increas small amount marin area current limit commerci fish drill relat motion support marin protect area high sea beyond nation jurisdict also pass these motion help revers tide habitat destruct pollut deplet world ocean said francin kershaw scienc fellow natur resourc defens council both emphas need marin protect area scientif support enhanc ocean health resili face global warm ocean acidif rapidli escal industri activ lanc morgan presid marin conserv institut also prais motion thi terrif news sure creat momentum establish marin reserv around world come year said know ocean need polit public support make hard decis late more resolut pass littl fuss they includ call gillnet fish threaten vaquita porpois mexico restrict trade pangolin other motion back adopt renew energi energi effici countri vote conduct onlin prior iucn congress
14,Bad moms: why messy motherhood is finally being accepted on screen,"Better Things opens with its protagonist, Sam Fox, texting at a shopping mall while her    daughter wails by her side. A nearby woman looks on judgmentally. “Do you want to buy her earrings?” retorts the   single mom. “’Cause that’s why she’s crying. ’Cause I won’t buy her earrings. ” Thanks to TV shows such as this and films such as Bad Moms and Bridget Jones’s Baby, a messier view of motherhood is having a moment in pop culture. No longer depicted as a sanctified state in which women don an apron and remove expertly prepared baked goods from the oven, motherhood  —   with its manifest challenges and residual body fluids  —   is increasingly being portrayed as more complex and more real. Sam embodies all those synonyms for “tired” attributed to single   working mothers: fraught, frazzled, overworked. She is a jobbing actor and so is constantly putting herself in a situation in which she has to prove she is good enough. She’s dating  —   but far from glossing over the logistics, as other shows have always done, Better Things offers a candid illustration of what that actually looks like. Sam invites an attractive director she’s working with back for dinner with her family and he is subjected to her teenage daughter’s anecdote about a school friend’s impromptu public defecation and her mother’s latently racist compulsion to acknowledge that the director is black. Needless to say, they don’t hook up. Sam can’t even watch porn without being intruded upon. Yet perhaps the most radical aspect of Better Things is that Sam has motivations and ambitions that have nothing to do with being a parent. And while she is a sometimes imperfect mother, it’s almost incidental she doesn’t particularly characterise herself as such, only acknowledges that she’s a product of her circumstances just doing her damned best. This summer, Bad Moms also railed against polished, prescriptive modes of motherhood. After kicking out her husband for an online affair, Mila Kunis throws down the gauntlet at a   meeting: “I’m done,” she announces, throwing off the weight of expectation. The film tackles an interesting and rarely aired topic:     (“sometimes I fantasise I get into a car accident, not a bad one, but I get injured, so I can stay in the hospital for a couple weeks”). Beholden to four children and an unsupportive husband, she is underslept and undersocialised, with no life to speak of beyond her role as mom.  The message is that the role of mother has extended far beyond keeping one’s children happy and healthy to encompass a host of thankless auxiliary duties (bake sales, extracurricular activities and looking hot while doing them) that it is fundamentally impossible to be a good one. To be a modern mother is to be a bad one, doomed to failure so why not stop trying to meet an impossible standard and instead retain one’s sense of self? Bad Moms points the finger at mothers perceived as perfect, as opposed to a patriarchal and innately sexist socialisation that demands women relinquish their careers, personal lives and humanity to focus squarely on their children.  In the UK there’s Motherland, Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehan’s sitcom about   motherhood and all of the appearance maintenance that comes with it. “Why don’t we have a nanny?” her husband asks, to which she responds: “Because I want to be raised the way I was, by my mother,” and not “because we are not Sheryl Sandberg and David Goldberg” which gives you an idea of the stakes here. When Julie is pitted against a gang of   “alpha mums” the alphas pour scorn over her for working. “Don’t you hate yourself?” they inquire. Julie finds an ally, whose    is denoted by the fact she doesn’t have herbal tea, in Liz. Single and working class, Liz is reviled by the other mothers, who are both terrified she will steal their husbands and discomfited because she doesn’t fit their prescriptive mold of parenting. Motherland aligns our notions of idealised parenthood with wealth, revealing the heinous classism innate to it. Why are fetishised symbols of   liberalism (organic food, extracurricular activities) fundamental to good parenting? What does that mean if you cannot afford it? The mothers who are flawed here are the seemingly perfect ones. Bridget Jones is perhaps the most renowned modern emblem   femininity in Bridget Jones’s Baby, she is struggling to identify the paternity of her unborn child. Though Bridget Jones puts the traditionally maligned female narrative front and centre, her “imperfections” still rest heavily on a few attributes: she is not teetotal, enjoys sex and is slightly heavier than most female actors in films. The Bridget Jones series has always been about wish fulfillment, later deconstructing the fairytale, usually to get content for the sequel. Pregnant at 43, Bridget wonders: “This might be the only chance I get,” noting that she “always imagined myself in OK! Magazine with the man of my dreams”. Bridget has always outsourced her happiness, previously to partners and romantic interests, now to her baby and the childlike notion of the happy ending. Like getting together with Colin Firth, having the baby you’ve always dreamed of doesn’t guarantee personal contentment. We take responsibility for our own happiness, mothers or not. And as the credits roll, we can’t help but wonder whether we’ll meet her again as we did at the beginning: crying on the sofa.  Perhaps the most viscerally frazzled mother to grace our screens in very recent memory is Winona Ryder’s Joyce in Stranger Things. While being drawn and overwrought in the wake of her son being abducted by an unknown paranormal entity is largely expected, there is much to imply she was every bit as nervy,   and chaotic    —   mostly because she’s left raising two teenage boys without any support, financial or otherwise, from their deadbeat dad. Uncomfortably, the end seems to imply she gets it together having come to appreciate what she might have lost (her child) serving up an idyllically   meal, despite having no obvious additional support or income. Throughout Better Things there are flashbacks to the person who we assume is the father of Sam’s children. In one, we see him wake up one of her children to tell them about what sounds like a spurious career opportunity. “I’ve got irons in the fire!” he says. “Don’t tell your mother I woke you. ” Later in the same episode, as she struggles to get through the mountainous list of shit that just needs to get done  —   taking out the trash, cooking dinner for her family, making sure her daughters haven’t gone to sleep without brushing their teeth  —   it becomes apparent. Are these mothers struggling only because of inadequate fathers?",better thing open protagonist text shop mall daughter wail side nearbi woman look judgment want ear retort singl caus cri caus ear thank show film mom bridget jone babi messier view motherhood moment cultur longer depict sanctifi state women apron remov expertli prepar bake good oven motherhood manifest challeng residu bodi fluid increasingli portray complex real embodi synonym tire attribut singl work mother fraught frazzl overwork job actor constantli put situat prove good enough date gloss logist show alway done better thing offer candid illustr actual look like invit attract director work back dinner famili subject teenag daughter anecdot school friend impromptu public defec mother latent racist compuls acknowledg director black needless hook even watch porn without intrud upon perhap radic aspect better thing motiv ambit noth parent sometim imperfect mother almost incident particularli characteris acknowledg product circumst damn best thi summer mom also rail polish prescript mode motherhood after kick husband onlin affair mila kuni throw gauntlet meet done announc throw weight expect film tackl interest rare air topic sometim fantasis accid injur stay hospit coupl week beholden four children unsupport husband underslept undersocialis life speak beyond role messag role mother extend beyond keep children happi healthi encompass host thankless auxiliari duti bake sale extracurricular activ look fundament imposs good modern mother doom failur stop tri meet imposs standard instead retain sens self mom point finger mother perceiv perfect oppos patriarch innat sexist socialis demand women relinquish career person live human focu squar children motherland sharon horgan graham linehan sitcom motherhood appear mainten come nanni husband ask respond becaus want rais mother sheryl sandberg david goldberg give idea stake when juli pit gang alpha mum alpha pour scorn work hate inquir juli find alli whose denot fact herbal singl work class revil mother terrifi steal husband discomfit prescript mold parent motherland align notion idealis parenthood wealth reveal heinou classism innat fetishis symbol liber organ food extracurricular activ fundament good parent what mean cannot afford mother flaw seemingli perfect one bridget jone perhap renown modern emblem feminin bridget jone babi struggl identifi patern unborn child though bridget jone put tradit malign femal narr front centr imperfect still rest heavili attribut teetot enjoy slightli heavier femal actor film bridget jone seri alway wish fulfil later deconstruct fairytal usual content sequel pregnant bridget wonder thi might chanc note alway imagin magazin dream bridget alway outsourc happi previous partner romant interest babi childlik notion happi end like get togeth colin firth babi alway dream guarante person content take respons happi mother credit roll help wonder whether meet begin cri sofa perhap viscer frazzl mother grace screen recent memori winona ryder joyc stranger thing while drawn overwrought wake abduct unknown paranorm entiti larg expect much impli everi nervi chaotic mostli left rais teenag boy without support financi otherwis deadbeat uncomfort seem impli get togeth come appreci might lost child serv idyl meal despit obviou addit support incom throughout better thing flashback person assum father children wake children tell sound like spuriou career opportun iron fire say tell mother woke later episod struggl mountain list shit need done take trash cook dinner famili make sure daughter gone sleep without brush teeth becom appar mother struggl inadequ father
15,Planned Parenthood: eight states now striving to repeal abortion restrictions,"Efforts are brewing in at least eight states to repeal abortion restrictions that appear to be unconstitutional after a major supreme court victory for abortion rights advocates. That is according to Planned Parenthood officials, who vowed on Thursday to support these efforts and any others that take advantage of Monday’s monumental decision. Planned Parenthood made the announcement the same day that Donald Trump, the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee, broke a puzzling   silence on the ruling, known as Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt. Speaking to conservative radio host Mike Gallagher, Trump echoed a promise to appoint supreme court justices who oppose abortion rights. “If we had Scalia was living or Scalia had been replaced by me, you wouldn’t have had that, OK?” he said. The decision was   suggesting the outcome would have been the same with Scalia’s vote or a conservative replacement. The court’s ruling on Monday struck down a Texas law that closed half the state’s abortion clinics by requiring all clinics to meet expensive,   standards, and all providers to have   privileges with a local hospital. In its ruling, the court found no evidence that the law made abortion safer, as its supporters claimed, and served only to make abortions harder to obtain. The law, said the majority, was therefore unconstitutional. Since the ruling was announced, calls at the state level to overturn similar restrictions spread like wildfire, Planned Parenthood officials said. Lawmakers are formulating specific plans to target similar abortion restrictions in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and they are broadly prepared to repeal laws in Florida, Michigan and Texas. In Tennessee, Planned Parenthood is looking to support litigation by the Center for Reproductive Rights against that state’s building requirement law. They will also target Missouri’s admitting privileges law. Earlier this week, officials with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and   signaled that they were prepared, if necessary, to mount a legal challenge. “This list is not final,” Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood’s executive   said on a call with reporters. Efforts to repeal harsh restrictions are sure to be met with solid resistance as long as the same lawmakers who passed the abortion restrictions still hold power. Republican lawmakers were overwhelmingly responsible for the abortion restrictions under fire, and in each of these states, the party still controls at least one house of the legislature, if not also the governor’s seat. Asked how successful a legislative campaign would be under those circumstances, officials with Planned Parenthood said they were confident that these efforts had “momentum”. “We might not win everything on the first day,” said Laguens. “We don’t think for one minute that people who have spent the last decade trying to take away women’s access to abortion   …     are all of a sudden going to see the light   …     But ‘by all means necessary’ really, is our strategy. ” Laguens suggested that raising the profile of these statehouse battles might also energize voters around November’s elections. “I think it’s a good idea for them to have a legislative strategy,” said Priscilla Smith, a professor at Yale Law School who has litigated abortion restrictions. Since a Republican takeover of many state legislatures kicked off a wave of abortion restrictions, she said, “The   movement has relied too heavily on litigation alone, and has not focused enough on legislation. ”   lawmakers will never support these efforts, Smith continued, but moderate lawmakers might be swayed. “It’s a waste of state resources to enforce these laws in court   …     The same argument can be made to a legislature. It’s an appeal to reason and   as much as it’s an appeal to   lawmakers. ” The laws being targeted have shuttered at least a dozen abortion clinics in a region already hurting for abortion access. In Missouri, a law that requires abortion providers to have   privileges with a local hospital has left the state with just one working abortion clinic, in St Louis. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Missouri, is licensed to offer abortions. But it was forced to stop providing the procedure after the University of Missouri, apparently under political pressure, suspended the clinic’s privileges at the university hospital. Chris Koster, the state’s Democratic attorney general has already questioned the constitutionality of the admitting privileges law in response to Monday’s ruling. Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia all require most abortion clinics to meet   building requirements. Those laws forced seven abortion clinics in Virginia alone to shut down, said Helene Krasnoff, the Planned Parenthood’s director of public policy litigation. At least another ten have closed in Arizona and Michigan. Some abortion restrictions have already been toppled by Monday’s ruling  —   no legislation required. These were states with ongoing litigation against abortion restrictions. Immediately after the ruling, Alabama attorney general Luther Strange announced that he was dropping the state’s defense of its admitting privilege law. The law would have forced four out of five Alabama abortion clinics to close. On Tuesday, the supreme court declined to hear a final appeal of Wisconsin’s admitting privilege law, effectively striking that law down for good. The restrictions Planned Parenthood and its allies are targeting are measures that are harder to challenge in court. Some of the laws have been on the books for many years, meaning the only abortion clinics left are in compliance. It is unclear, in those cases, if the clinics would have standing to bring a legal challenge. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked another state abortion restriction, although not as a direct result of Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt. District judge Tanya Walton Pratt blocked an Indiana law which barred abortions when the reason was “race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex or a diagnosis or potential diagnosis” of a disability or malformation.",effort brew least eight state repeal abort restrict appear unconstitut major suprem court victori abort right advoc that accord plan parenthood offici vow thursday support effort other take advantag monday monument decis plan parenthood made announc donald trump presumpt presidenti nomine broke puzzl silenc rule known whole woman health hellerstedt speak conserv radio host mike gallagh trump echo promis appoint suprem court justic oppos abort right scalia live scalia replac said decis suggest outcom would scalia vote conserv replac court rule monday struck texa close half state abort clinic requir clinic meet expens standard provid privileg local hospit rule court found evid made abort safer support claim serv make abort harder obtain said major therefor unconstitut sinc rule announc call state level overturn similar restrict spread like wildfir plan parenthood offici said lawmak formul specif plan target similar abort restrict arizona pennsylvania virginia broadli prepar repeal law florida michigan texa tennesse plan parenthood look support litig center reproduct right state build requir they also target missouri admit privileg earlier week offici plan parenthood kansa signal prepar necessari mount legal challeng thi list final dawn laguen plan parenthood execut said call report effort repeal harsh restrict sure solid resist long lawmak pass abort restrict still hold power republican lawmak overwhelmingli respons abort restrict fire state parti still control least hous legislatur also governor seat ask success legisl campaign would circumst offici plan parenthood said confid effort momentum might everyth first said laguen think minut peopl spent last decad tri take away women access abort sudden go light mean necessari realli strategi laguen suggest rais profil statehous battl might also energ voter around novemb elect think good idea legisl strategi said priscilla smith professor yale school litig abort restrict sinc republican takeov mani state legislatur kick wave abort restrict said movement reli heavili litig alon focus enough legisl lawmak never support effort smith continu moder lawmak might sway wast state resourc enforc law court argument made legislatur appeal reason much appeal lawmak law target shutter least dozen abort clinic region alreadi hurt abort access missouri requir abort provid privileg local hospit left state work abort clinic loui plan parenthood clinic columbia missouri licens offer abort forc stop provid procedur univers missouri appar polit pressur suspend clinic privileg univers hospit chri koster state democrat attorney gener alreadi question constitution admit privileg respons monday rule arizona pennsylvania michigan virginia requir abort clinic meet build requir those law forc seven abort clinic virginia alon shut said helen krasnoff plan parenthood director public polici litig least anoth close arizona michigan some abort restrict alreadi toppl monday rule legisl requir these state ongo litig abort restrict immedi rule alabama attorney gener luther strang announc drop state defens admit privileg would forc four five alabama abort clinic close tuesday suprem court declin hear final appeal wisconsin admit privileg effect strike good restrict plan parenthood alli target measur harder challeng court some law book mani year mean abort clinic left complianc unclear case clinic would stand bring legal challeng thursday feder judg block anoth state abort restrict although direct result whole woman health hellerstedt district judg tanya walton pratt block indiana bar abort reason race color nation origin ancestri diagnosi potenti diagnosi disabl malform
16,’Trust can be restored’: Icelanders on their parliamentary election,"Halldora was born and raised in Iceland and currently works in Reykjavik. She feels people have finally had enough of the current government’s lack of transparency. “I’ve joined in the protests at Austurvöllur, the square in front of the Parliament, many times during these last three and a half years this government’s been in power. The mood current mood is kind of   ‘We’ve had enough! ’” In spite of the protests, Halldora believes many voters have not yet decided which party to vote for. “The only thing people know is that they’re not voting for the parties in power, because nothing will ever change with them in charge. ” She hopes that the election result will give a chance for a more   coalition to take charge. “The polls are showing that as many as four opposition parties can join forces after the election. I think it can work. Some of the parties really want to change things and have more transparency in the system as a whole. I’m hoping for a real change this time. ”  Baldur Sigurðsson is a mathematician who grew up in the cities of Kópavogur and Hafnarfjörður. He’s looking forward to political change after the parliamentary election, confident that people have had enough of the parties currently in power. “Since this government came in in 2013, there’s been a lot of active resentment against it. Although it was no small drop of news, the Panama Papers scandal was the thing that pushed it over the edge. I’m personally hoping to see the Pirate Party, left greens, social democrats and bright future form a government. I think trust can be restored in Iceland if the right people get in. ” As a high school student in Reykjavik this will be the first time Kjartan Skarphéðinsson has had a chance to vote in an election. But having three family members involved in three different political parties, he’s always been very interested in Icelandic politics. “Most people I know are excited about the election. There have been plenty of conversations recently that eventually turn to the election and who people are planning to vote for. We’ll hopefully get a lot of new blood in and get rid of the current government. ”  While the radical Pirate Party looks set to have a good election, Kjartan is still cautious about writing off the parties currently in power, despite the Panama Paper revelations and accusations of cronyism. “I think people who have traditionally voted for the parties in power are apathetic. They know about the corruption going on but still see the current government as a better alternative than the inexperienced Pirate Party or the traditionally disliked establishment   parties that lead during the recession and thus had to make some large cuts. There is also a big difference between the voting demographics in the countryside and the cities. ” Galdur was born and raised in Iceland and works as an IT professional. He has seldom seen a more indecisive mood in the country ahead of an election: “I’m not sure who I’m voting for yet, but it will definitely be an opposition party. The ruling parties have both been implicated in the Panama Papers and that has tainted their integrity and people’s trust towards them. Their poor results in the   polls, despite an upturn in our economy, aren’t surprising. ”  Despite the uncertainty among people, Galdur believes the media coverage leading up to the election has been excellent. “I think RÚV, the state TV station, and other outlets are doing a good job providing all the parties with air time and giving them a fair chance to present their case to the public. ” Whoever wins the parliamentary election, Galdur is clear about what he wants to see from a new government. “The tax system needs to be fairer   the highest earners having to contribute more. There needs to be more funds channeled into our health system and also towards improving our roads and tourist attractions. Above all, the blatant cronyism needs to stop   the appointment of friends and relatives, allowing the sale of high profit companies and properties to friends and family, lowering taxes for the rich while putting higher burdens on the low and middle classes. It all needs to stop. We need more integrity. ” Axel works for the government and is predicting real change after Saturday’s election. “The four establishment parties are facing their worst electoral outcomes ever. We have three new parties that could grab as much as 40% of the vote. There is a fairly strong sentiment among voters to show their dissatisfaction with the political establishment. This sentiment is far stronger now than in the wake of the economic crash back in 2008. ”  With the current coalition partners, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, not going to win enough seats to continue in government, Axel thinks other parties will get a chance to form a coalition. “Icelandic politicians needs to distance themselves entirely from special interests and convince their voters that they are first and foremost focused on the public’s interest. Politicians also need to introduce more transparency at all levels of government. Increased opportunities for the public to exert a greater political influence will empower the people and make them feel like they can rein in the politicians. ” Runar was born and raised in the village of Seydisfjordur on Iceland’s east coast. He works as a team leader in the local fish processing plant. “The fishing industry is still strong, but there’s some uncertainty about what will happen after the election. The rightwing politicians want to keep the industry more or less the same, but the parties on the left want to make radical changes. Some of the biggest companies in fishing are benefactors of the Independence party. ”  Runar hopes there will be a political change that can benefit both his own industry and regain people’s trust in the country’s politicians. “I don’t think there’s apathy towards politics in Iceland. You can’t turn on the radio or TV without being bombarded by election news. People seem to be interested, but I suppose the turnout will show us how interested they really are. There is a certain level of animosity towards the politicians that were found out to be involved in the Panama Papers scandal. People are not happy to be in financial quarantine themselves, while at the same time observing politicians stashing money offshore. Whoever is elected also needs to look at a health system that is in tatters and ensure that everyone has equal access to it. ” Matt currently works in the Icelandic public sector and lives in Reykjavik. “The mood in Iceland is interesting. It’s been a much shorter campaign cycle this time round than last time in April 2013, mostly because everyone knew those elections were coming well in advance. ” Matt believes there’s plenty of interest among the public and that the coverage of the elections has gone far to ignite this. “There’s been regular television debates, often with anything up to ten or 12 participants, and regular opinion polls dominating the front pages. The mood is not one of apathy, but I would say there are a lot of people still undecided where their vote will go. ”  Matt believes there are different outcomes that can realistically happen once the votes have been counted. “The Pirate Party might get a shot at governing, people might stick with whom they know and ignore the recent scandals, or another party altogether might have a late surge of support. A   coalition looks simply unworkable. I don’t see how they could all work in government or in coalition. The best option would be a government of just the three with the most seats. I would reckon that will be Pirates, Left Greens and either Social Democrats or Bright Future. ”  Whichever way the vote goes Matt echoes other people’s feelings about the cronyism in Icelandic politics. “Polticians need to show a bit more humility, show respect to the office they hold and the trust the people have given them. Just this week we’ve had reports of both the Foreign Minister and the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister appointing their advisors to the boards of public bodies. It’s this sort of cronyism that pollutes our politics. ”",halldora born rais iceland current work reykjavik feel peopl final enough current govern lack transpar join protest austurv llur squar front parliament mani time last three half year govern power mood current mood kind enough spite protest halldora believ mani voter decid parti vote thing peopl know vote parti power noth ever chang charg hope elect result give chanc coalit take charg poll show mani four opposit parti join forc elect think work some parti realli want chang thing transpar system whole hope real chang time baldur sigur sson mathematician grew citi pavogur hafnarfj look forward polit chang parliamentari elect confid peopl enough parti current power sinc govern came activ resent although small drop news panama paper scandal thing push edg person hope pirat parti left green social democrat bright futur form govern think trust restor iceland right peopl high school student reykjavik first time kjartan skarph insson chanc vote elect three famili member involv three differ polit parti alway interest iceland polit most peopl know excit elect there plenti convers recent eventu turn elect peopl plan vote hope blood current govern while radic pirat parti look good elect kjartan still cautiou write parti current power despit panama paper revel accus cronyism think peopl tradit vote parti power apathet they know corrupt go still current govern better altern inexperienc pirat parti tradit dislik establish parti lead recess thu make larg cut there also differ vote demograph countrysid citi galdur born rais iceland work profession seldom seen indecis mood countri ahead elect sure vote definit opposit parti rule parti implic panama paper taint integr peopl trust toward their poor result poll despit upturn economi surpris despit uncertainti among peopl galdur believ media coverag lead elect excel think state station outlet good provid parti time give fair chanc present case public whoever win parliamentari elect galdur clear want govern system need fairer highest earner contribut there need fund channel health system also toward improv road tourist attract abov blatant cronyism need stop appoint friend rel allow sale high profit compani properti friend famili lower tax rich put higher burden middl class need stop need integr axel work govern predict real chang saturday elect four establish parti face worst elector outcom ever three parti could grab much vote there fairli strong sentiment among voter show dissatisfact polit establish thi sentiment stronger wake econom crash back with current coalit partner independ parti progress parti go enough seat continu govern axel think parti chanc form coalit iceland politician need distanc entir special interest convinc voter first foremost focus public interest politician also need introduc transpar level govern increas opportun public exert greater polit influenc empow peopl make feel like rein politician runar born rais villag seydisfjordur iceland east coast work team leader local fish process plant fish industri still strong uncertainti happen elect rightw politician want keep industri less parti left want make radic chang some biggest compani fish benefactor independ parti runar hope polit chang benefit industri regain peopl trust countri politician think apathi toward polit iceland turn radio without bombard elect news peopl seem interest suppos turnout show interest realli there certain level animos toward politician found involv panama paper scandal peopl happi financi quarantin time observ politician stash money offshor whoever elect also need look health system tatter ensur everyon equal access matt current work iceland public sector live reykjavik mood iceland interest much shorter campaign cycl time round last time april mostli everyon knew elect come well advanc matt believ plenti interest among public coverag elect gone ignit there regular televis debat often anyth particip regular opinion poll domin front page mood apathi would peopl still undecid vote matt believ differ outcom realist happen vote count pirat parti might shot govern peopl might stick know ignor recent scandal anoth parti altogeth might late surg support coalit look simpli unwork could work govern coalit best option would govern three seat would reckon pirat left green either social democrat bright futur whichev vote goe matt echo peopl feel cronyism iceland polit poltician need show humil show respect offic hold trust peopl given just week report foreign minist agricultur fisheri minist appoint advisor board public bodi sort cronyism pollut polit
17,Clinton endorsed by New York Times as Warren says Trump is ’making hate OK’,"As Hillary Clinton prepared for the first presidential debate against Donald Trump on Monday, campaign surrogates spoke in swing states and the New York Times published a strongly worded endorsement of the former secretary of state. The Times’ editorial board said that as first lady, senator for New York and secretary of state, Clinton had shown herself to be “one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation” capable of fostering bipartisan cooperation. It also called Trump “the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history”. In New Hampshire, where, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Clinton holds a 44% to 38% lead, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren accused Trump and the Republican party of “making hate OK”. In Ohio, where Trump leads by 45% to 42% cast members from the 1990s TV show The West Wing, which portrayed an imaginary Democratic administration, hit the stump for Clinton. Echoing concerns among Democrats about motivating voters, particularly the young, to vote for a candidate who has struggled to generate campaign momentum, the Times’ editorial board argued that Trump’s negative qualities were not enough to merit an endorsement of Clinton.  “Running down the other guy won’t suffice,” wrote the board, which is separate from the newsroom. “The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn’t Donald Trump. The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs Clinton’s capacity to rise to them. “A lifetime’s commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work,” the editorial board added. Addressing Clinton’s poor poll ratings regarding trust and favourability, it said: “Mrs Clinton’s occasional missteps, combined with attacks on her trustworthiness, have distorted perceptions of her character.  “She is one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation, whose willingness to study and correct course is rare in an age of unyielding partisanship. ” Grouping as examples the rise of Trump, the Brexit vote for Britain to leave the European Union, the spread of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and the resurgence of Russia under Vladimir Putin, the Times said the next president would take office “with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march”. It added: “War, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity. ”  Regarding the candidate’s   battles with the press over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, which flared up again on Friday with the release of FBI notes and the news a judge had ruled some such emails must be released to the public before election day, the Times said: “That decision deserved scrutiny, and it’s had it.  “Now, considered alongside the real challenges that will occupy the next president, that email server, which has consumed so much of this campaign, looks like a matter for the help desk.  “And, viewed against those challenges, Mr Trump shrinks to his true     proportions, as we’ll argue in detail on Monday. ” The paper promised a scathing perspective on Trump for Monday, saying he is “the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history”. In a preview, the Times said the Republican candidate “discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway”.  On the campaign trail in Nashua, Warren spoke to volunteers at a Clinton campaign office. “We’re here to say hate is not OK,” she said. “We build a stronger America together  —   that’s what this is about. ” Warren was scheduled to make three stops in the state, where a Senate contest between incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democratic governor Maggie Hassan remains close. Warren sought to tie Ayotte to Trump  —   the senator has said she would “stand up” to Trump but nonetheless vote for him  —   saying she had not thought a major presidential candidate would base a campaign on scapegoating Mexicans, women and Muslims. “What Donald Trump is doing is not what any of us thought a man who’s running for president would do,” she said. “He’s found something much uglier that he wants to make the basis of his campaign. ” Warren was also critical of the   Texas senator Ted Cruz, who on Friday said he would vote for Trump despite having denounced him, while they were primary rivals, for Trump’s personal attacks against the senator’s wife and father.  In July, Cruz refused to endorse Trump in a speech to the Republican convention, earning boos, then explained his speech by saying he was not a “servile puppy”. Explaining his decision in a statement posted to Facebook on Friday, Cruz said: “Even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable. ” On Saturday, Warren asked: “Is that really what your word is worth, Ted Cruz?”",hillari clinton prepar first presidenti debat donald trump monday campaign surrog spoke swing state york time publish strongli word endors former secretari state time editori board said first ladi senat york secretari state clinton shown tenaci politician gener capabl foster bipartisan cooper also call trump worst nomine forward major parti modern american histori hampshir accord real clear polit averag clinton hold lead massachusett senat elizabeth warren accus trump republican parti make hate ohio trump lead cast member show west wing portray imaginari democrat administr stump clinton echo concern among democrat motiv voter particularli young vote candid struggl gener campaign momentum time editori board argu trump neg qualiti enough merit endors clinton run suffic wrote board separ newsroom best case hillari clinton cannot donald trump best case instead challeng countri face clinton capac rise lifetim commit solv problem real world qualifi hillari clinton countri work editori board ad address clinton poor poll rate regard trust favour said clinton occasion misstep combin attack trustworthi distort percept charact tenaci politician gener whose willing studi correct cours rare unyield partisanship group exampl rise trump brexit vote britain leav european union spread islam state milit iraq syria resurg russia vladimir putin time said next presid would take offic bigot tribalist movement leader march ad terror pressur global erod democrat valu fray allianc challeng ideal toler chariti regard candid battl press privat email server secretari state flare friday releas note news judg rule email must releas public elect time said that decis deserv scrutini consid alongsid real challeng occupi next presid email server consum much campaign look like matter help desk view challeng trump shrink true proport argu detail monday paper promis scath perspect trump monday say worst nomine forward major parti modern american histori preview time said republican candid disclos noth concret plan promis moon offer star layaway campaign trail nashua warren spoke volunt clinton campaign offic hate said build stronger america togeth warren schedul make three stop state senat contest incumb republican kelli ayott democrat governor maggi hassan remain close warren sought ayott trump senat said would stand trump nonetheless vote say thought major presidenti candid would base campaign scapego mexican women muslim what donald trump thought run presid would said found someth much uglier want make basi campaign warren also critic texa senat cruz friday said would vote trump despit denounc primari rival trump person attack senat wife father juli cruz refus endors trump speech republican convent earn boo explain speech say servil puppi explain decis statement post facebook friday cruz said even though area signific disagr nomine measur hillari clinton wholli unaccept saturday warren ask realli word worth cruz
18,"Ignore the naysayers. America can handle 110,000 more refugees","Barack Obama’s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110, 000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a furious reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history. As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the “Jacobin” ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than   immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone. Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama’s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10, 000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state. Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40, 000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy. As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110, 000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America’s goal has been 85, 000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States.  In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25, 000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada’s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups,   associations and other   organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools.  Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10, 000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed.  I don’t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president’s modest proposal.",barack obama announc unit state propos admit refuge cours next year elicit furiou reaction republican leader thi predict spirit xenophobia taken hold unit state happen sever previou occas american histori earli year establish republ congress adopt natur intend keep radic could promot sedit main target french might spread jacobin ideolog french revolut centuri focu exclus chines explicitli kept chines exclus that repeal becam embarrass china alli unit state japan earli part centuri number measur adopt limit admiss southern european italian ostens thought like spread anarchist ideolog immigr northern europ thing gone today cours main focu denounc obama propos syrian refuge unit state admit least resettl unit state seem well though indiana governor mike penc donald trump run mate tri keep state addit refuge syria would constitut minor obama propos admit next year number project countri middl east south asia elect year republican nomine presid swept asid oppon nomin say would deport million undocu immigr mexico would muslim enter unit state made xenophobia look like win polit strategi appar wealthi countri million peopl easili absorb refuge year end septemb america goal refuge increas modest given scale global refuge crisi compar poorli neighbor canada popul percent unit state brief period novemb februari canada admit syrian refuge well mani refuge countri canada highli popular prime minist justin trudeau polit oppon tri offic exploit xenophobia absorpt syrian refuge accept approvingli enthusiast great major canadian larg number refuge sponsor canadian church group associ organ paid initi cost resettl help refuge find home learn english job children school canada care screen refuge accept resettl unit state typic american screen program refuge last year that possibl orderli program establish reason refuge program conduct canada unit state admit syrian refuge past year tend succeed think american inher xenophob canadian neighbor matter much els polit opportun play role seem bring worst mani peopl includ denounc presid modest propos
19,Golden State Warriors beat Oklahoma City Thunder to return to NBA finals,"The Golden State Warriors came from behind to topple the Oklahoma City Thunder   in Monday’s Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, completing a rally from a   series deficit to seal a place in the NBA finals for the second year in a row. Stephen Curry scored a   36 points to spark the Warriors, who trailed by as many as 13 during the first half but used a   run in the third quarter to open an   lead entering the fourth. His Golden State   Klay Thompson added 21 points and six   to follow up his   performance in Game 6 on Saturday, when the Warriors needed a furious rally to force Monday’s    finale. Golden State become the 10th team in NBA history to rally from a     deficit in   postseason series and win it. “This may be the greatest team in the history of the NBA,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said afterward. “They do things like make big shots and do some of those things. We were right there every step of the way with them, and this was a   team and world champions. We’ve got to give them credit. ” The series outcome evoked the    expression: were the Warriors the only team good enough to pull off such a comeback  —   or were the Thunder the only team combustable enough to lose from such a winning position? It might be that it was a little bit of both. The history was not in the Thunder’s favor.   teams were   in home Game 7s, according to ESPN. There have been 36 teams to lose Game 6 at home with a   series lead. Of those, less than half came back to win Game 7. But more than that, Russell Westbrook was off his game, shooting for    from the floor on Monday night. Kevin Durant shot    for a total of 27 points, his   Game 7 performance ever. “We laid it all out there,” a somber Durant said. “Everybody left their soul out on the court. We have no regrets. ” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said beforehand he was going to make “11 alterations to the gameplan” one of which was starting Andre Iguodala after a strong showing in Game 6 instead of Harrison Barnes. Iguodala added seven points and was aggressive on defense. Saturday’s Game 6 appeared to be the beginning of the end for the Thunder’s charmed postseason as Oklahoma City blew yet another lead in the fourth quarter. The Thunder were notorious for squandering leads in the final minutes of   games. At one point their number of   collapses were worse than the Philadelphia 76ers, one of the worst teams in the league this year. There is also plenty of speculation about the future of Durant, who will soon be a free agent. A player of his talents could easily make over $100m on a new contract. But Durant, understandably, did not want to discuss such matters on Monday night. “I mean, we just lost like 30 minutes ago, so I haven’t even thought about it,” Durant said. “I’m just embracing my   and just reflecting on the season. I’ll think about that stuff, I don’t know when. But we just lost an hour ago, 30 minutes ago, so I don’t know. ” Bay Area natives Andy Samberg and   were seen in the Oracle Arena crowd, as was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who arrived at   after campaigning in northern California. Now the Cleveland Cavaliers will head to California for a much anticipated rematch of last year’s NBA finals, which the Warriors won in six games.

20,Babies breastfed within an hour of birth are less likely to die. Yet only 50% are,"What happens in an hour can make all the difference. When I had my first baby, the support I received from my nurse was indispensable in helping me initiate and continue breastfeeding. It may not be obvious, but putting newborns to the breast within the first hour of life can make the difference between life and death. Delaying the start of breastfeeding beyond one hour after birth can raise a newborns risk of dying by 80% compared to those who are breastfed immediately. Newborns now account for nearly half of all deaths of children under five. Early breastfeeding plays a critical part in reducing newborn mortality and keeping babies healthy. But are we doing everything possible to make that happen?  It turns out we’re not. New research from Unicef shows that more than half of all newborns are not breastfed within one hour of birth. That means that 77 million newborns  —   over 50% of babies born each year   are losing out on the benefits of early initiation, exposing them to a higher risk of disease and death. This is happening because women are not getting the support they need around the time of birth, even when a doctor, nurse or midwife is assisting their delivery. Globally, more than three quarters of all mothers give birth with the help of a skilled birth attendant. But in many hospitals, rather than initiating the practice of breastfeeding by immediately placing a newborn on the mother’s chest,   attendants will take the baby away to give the mother time to rest or feed the newborn formula. In the Middle East, North Africa and in South Asia, women who deliver with a skilled birth attendant are less likely to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour of life, compared to women who deliver with unskilled attendants or relatives. When babies are given alternatives to breastmilk, they breastfeed less often, making it harder for mothers to start and continue breastfeeding. In some countries, the rise in caesarean deliveries has reduced this crucial practice and delayed breastfeeding initiation however, with the right support, even most newborns delivered by Caesarean section can be put to the breast within the first hour of life. Traditional practices also interfere with getting an early start to breastfeeding, depriving newborns of the essential nutrients, antibodies and    contact with their mother that protect them from disease and death. In India, some women are taught to discard colostrum —  the   breast milk a mother produces right after birth. In Nigeria, some newborns are given water or tea in lieu of breast milk, putting them at risk of diarrhea and malnutrition. Countries in other parts of the world are inundated with formula marketing, which has led to plummeting breastfeeding rates.  Placing newborns on their mother’s bare chest  —   known as    contact  —   immediately after birth helps reduce mortality by regulating a baby’s heart rate, temperature and breathing, while also facilitating breastfeeding. Not only that, exposure to the bacteria on the mother’s breast helps to colonize a newborn’s digestive system with essential antibodies. Immediate    contact promotes bonding between newborn and mother and ensures that babies receive the nurturing they need from the very first moments they enter the world.  And mothers practicing early    contact and early initiation of breastfeeding with their newborns are more likely to produce sufficient milk, breastfeed within the first months of their baby’s life, and continue breastfeeding longer  —   a practice proven to improve health outcomes for both children and mothers. The Lancet reported earlier this year that breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months could save more than 800, 000 children’s lives each year because it acts as a baby’s first vaccine, protecting infants from diseases, and giving them a perfectly adapted nutritional supply they need at each developmental stage. This amounts to a 13% reduction in the deaths of children under five and also supports healthy brain development, increased IQ scores and better school performance for all children. Breastfeeding is a powerful intervention  —   it’s   backed by research and doesn’t require preparation or expensive new medications. Breastfeeding has incredible developmental benefits, and, in areas that lack access to clean environment and clean water to mix with formula powder, saves babies from   diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. To be sure, there are many barriers to breastfeeding we must work to overcome so mothers who want to breastfeed are able to, and there are a small number of mothers for whom breastfeeding isn’t an option. But to serve millions of mothers and children better, one simple and important thing we can do now is support early initiation of breastfeeding. Providing new mothers with guidance on initiating breastfeeding, not supplying any liquids or foods other than breastmilk and ensuring that staff are appropriately trained are all simple adjustments that can help a woman breastfeed successfully.

There’s nothing illegal about these tips, but some may find them unsporting. Others rely on them to get an edge over their competitors. Here are five tips to help give you a boost. Increasing the level of your trainer is crucial to get access to both higher level Pokémon and the tools to catch them. Above level 20 you gain access to Ultra balls, which make life a lot easier when trying to keep hold of the rarer beasts. Levelling up can be a bit of a slow grind, but Pidgey stacking can boost your trainer by at least one level. It’s pretty simple. All you need are lots of Pidgey and a lucky egg. Low powered Pidgey are plentiful in most places and require only 12 candies to evolve into Pidgeotto, an act that normally gives you 500XP. With a lucky egg active, which doubles your XP for 30 minutes that becomes 1, 000XP per evolution. By collecting loads of them and evolving as many as possible in 30 minutes with a lucky egg you can set somewhere in the region of 30, 000 to 40, 000XP at full burn with a strong internet connection. At lower levels that’s enough to jump at least one, possibly two levels. After you’re done with all the Pidgey, just trade in the resulting Pidgeotto to start collecting candies to do it again. You can use any Pokémon that can evolve, of course, but Pidgey is the most candy efficient given its abundance. Not all Pokémon are created equally, that much is obvious. But what you might not know is that two Pokémon of the same type and level are also not equal. Each monster has a series of hidden values that dictate how much HP and CP it has per level, as well as its secret energy rating, which determines how long it takes for the special attack energy bar to fill up. These   individual values (IVs) cannot be directly interrogated, but using some calculations based on the health and power of a particular Pokémon for its given level, you can infer them. By doing so you can work out which Pokémon are worth spending time improving using stardust and evolution candy and which are not. When you get to a high level with your trainer, these IVs can make around a  % in both HP and CP, which when your Pokémon are maxed out, could mean the difference between beating rivals and losing battles in the gym. There are several ways to use IVs, with the simplest being to compare Pokémon of a same type and similar level to see which has the higher CP and HP values. But for those that want to take it further, an IV calculator is required. The best is arguably that created by Reddit Pokémon Go community, the Silph Road, which has been conducting research into various attributes of Pokémon Go. The IV rater allows you to quickly estimate how good your Pokémon can be, and whether it is worth hanging on to, simply by moving some sliders. There are others, including an IV calculator app for Android, although they may or may not be accurate they are worth using if you’re serious about trying to take over and hold gyms as you reach the highest trainer levels. One of the more powerful and easier to get Pokémon in the game are the evolved forms of Eevee, but unlike most other beasts in the game, Eevee has three different evolved forms in Pokémon Go. Eevee can become the   Flareon, the   Jolteon or the   Vaporeon. They’re all solid in their own ways, with some being more effective in certain situations than others. But the most powerful for both attack and defence of the lot is Vaporeon. To choose, rather than have Eevee randomly evolve into one of them, you have to rename your Eevee after one of the Eevee brothers from the Pokémon TV show before evolving it. Calling it Pyro spawns a Flareon, while Sparky becomes a Jolteon and Rainer a Vaporeon. Rename Eevee, hit save and then reload the Pokémon Go app just to make sure the name saved. Then evolve the renamed Eevee to net yourself your desired Pokémon. This should work at least once, but your milage may vary. Make sure you check out the IVs of the Eevee you’re planning to evolve to make sure you’ve got a   one before using all your candy. Hatching eggs is one of the best ways to get powerful Pokémon, but if you don’t walk for your commute or in your general day, it can be hard to clock up the kilometres required to incubate them. You might find, however, that if you leave your smartphone plugged in and on a desk, that your location wanders around, enough to add up to half a kilometre a day to your walking total in my testing depending on how accurate the smartphone can put your location. Every little helps, particularly if you don’t have a drone to hand. Once you’ve caught your 100th Pidgey, unless you’re Pidgey stacking, you’re probably after some of the more rare Pokémon. You could aimlessly wander the streets or rely on word of mouth, but if you’re less keen on clocking up the kilometres, there’s a better way. Various maps or radar apps have popped up that promise to show where Pokémon are and for how long at any given moment. Having tested Pokévision, I’ve found it accurate on over 10 occasions for various Pokémon. Putting in your location and searching will bring up all the Pokémon around you, but you can narrow down your search to specific Pokémon and search a much wider area. You still have to put the leg work into getting there before the timer runs out, but Pokévision, and others like it, should help take the guess work out of catching the less common varieties of Pokémon.",onc master basic advanc curv ball tri luck gym time turn notch start exploit game boost chanc champion there noth illeg tip find unsport other reli edg competitor here five tip help give boost increas level trainer crucial access higher level tool catch abov level gain access ultra ball make life easier tri keep hold rarer beast level slow grind pidgey stack boost trainer least level pretti simpl need lot pidgey lucki power pidgey plenti place requir candi evolv pidgeotto normal give with lucki activ doubl minut becom evolut collect load evolv mani possibl minut lucki somewher region full burn strong internet connect lower level enough jump least possibl level after done pidgey trade result pidgeotto start collect candi evolv cours pidgey candi effici given abund creat equal much obviou might know type level also equal each monster seri hidden valu dictat much level well secret energi rate determin long take special attack energi fill these individu valu cannot directli interrog use calcul base health power particular given level infer work worth spend time improv use stardust evolut candi when high level trainer make around max could mean differ beat rival lose battl there sever way simplest compar type similar level higher valu want take calcul requir best arguabl creat reddit commun silph road conduct research variou attribut rater allow quickli estim good whether worth hang simpli move slider there other includ calcul android although accur worth use seriou tri take hold gym reach highest trainer level power easier game evolv form eeve unlik beast game eeve three differ evolv form eeve becom flareon jolteon vaporeon they solid way effect certain situat other power attack defenc vaporeon choos rather eeve randomli evolv renam eeve eeve brother show evolv call pyro spawn flareon sparki becom jolteon rainer vaporeon renam eeve save reload make sure name save then evolv renam eeve desir thi work least milag vari make sure check eeve plan evolv make sure use candi hatch egg best way power walk commut gener hard clock kilometr requir incub might find howev leav smartphon plug desk locat wander around enough half kilometr walk total test depend accur smartphon locat everi littl help particularli drone hand onc caught pidgey unless pidgey stack probabl rare could aimlessli wander street reli word mouth less keen clock kilometr better variou map radar app pop promis show long given moment have test vision found accur occas variou put locat search bring around narrow search specif search much wider area still work get timer run vision other like help take guess work catch less common varieti
22,"For Donald Trump, this was more than a terrible week. It was a turning point","What have you accomplished this week? Whatever it is, you don’t come close to Donald Trump. Trump has demolished his campaign, his brand and his party. He has squandered his   pick and his convention, and several battleground states along with them. He picked several fights he could not win, and showed no sign of learning from his own failure. It would be tempting to say this was just another week in the bizarre life of the Republican presidential nominee. But it wasn’t. This week was a decisive turning point in the 2016 election, and there have been remarkably few of them in an campaign that is supposedly volatile.  In fact, the volatility and unpredictability of this election doesn’t come from polls or votes, but from the character of a single man: Donald J Trump. The real surprise of 2016 is how constant this contest has been.  Trump led the primary polls from the beginning and never lost his lead. He only surprised the chattering classes by defying their certainty that he would lose. That certainty was founded on nothing related to polling data, but rather their sheer disgust and disbelief with Trump’s politics. Having defied expectations once, Trump is now supposed to be able to defy polling gravity forever more. That would be a strange conclusion to draw from the primaries, but here we are.  Echoing the Trump campaign, the Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren distilled this position on Thursday, as she quizzed the   Karl Rove. “I see the rallies and they’re big, and I see the poll numbers, and he’s slipping in the polls,” she said. “I’m not so sure how accurate these polls are. ”  Rove  —   the man who challenged the Fox News election desk as it called the 2012 election for Obama  —   was incredulous. “You’re assuming first of all, the polls are not reliable  —   all of them  —   and second of all, that a better test of this is the size of the crowds he gets at his rallies, which are big and enthusiastic,” he explained. “But I would remind you in the closing days in the 1984 presidential campaign, Walter Mondale was drawing large and enthusiastic rallies as he went on to narrowly win one state. ”  To put it delicately, this is a difficult moment in the education of Donald Trump. For a candidate who leads every stump speech bragging about his poll numbers, there is less and less material every day. Ergo the polls  —   just like the media, Clinton and democracy itself  —   must be crooked.  It would be nice to call this a logical fallacy, but those are two words that should never be placed within physical proximity of Donald J Trump.  “I see some great polls,” he told a rally in Virginia on Tuesday. “I see one from the Los Angeles Times, just came out, where we’re ahead by four or five points. I see one from CNN where we’re down. I think these polls, I don’t know. There’s something about these polls. There’s something phony. ”  That was the day after he told voters there was an even bigger problem with this confounding election. “I’m afraid the election’s going to be rigged,” he told voters in Ohio. “I have to be honest. ”  Those who live in the   world are having an easier time understanding Trump’s challenges. The simpler explanation is that he is losing because of his own performance and personality. As the saying goes, campaigns are like fish: they rot from the head down. This one stinks already and it’s only the start of August. Barack Obama put it more diplomatically at his   press conference. “If Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up losing, then, you know, maybe he can raise some questions,” Obama ventured. “That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment. ”  No, it doesn’t. In any campaign cycle, there are periods when the dynamic turns decisively in one direction. While the dynamic can shift more than once, as the cycle runs its course there are fewer and fewer opportunities to do so. George HW Bush engineered one of those shifts after his 1988 convention, turning a   deficit into an   lead, backed up by devastating TV ads. Bill Clinton enjoyed one of those shifts in 1992 when Ross Perot initially dropped out of the race, and Clinton never really lost his lead again.  In 2004, John Kerry staged a decent convention and held a narrow lead, but was soon destroyed by a better Republican convention and the   attacks that followed. Four years later, Barack Obama didn’t bury John McCain until the financial collapse that followed both conventions. How does the past week of 2016 compare to those   moments in recent presidential history? Pretty favorably. Trump miserably misjudged his dispute with the gold star parents of a fallen American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was Muslim. He drove a wedge between himself and the few Republican leaders who publicly tolerated his nomination. And he seriously undermined his own brand of patriotic nationalism, as well as his party’s reputation for strength on national security. The lasting impact of Trump’s disastrous week came from its echoes of the Democratic convention. Each round of dispute with the Khan family only served to reinforce the criticism that he had sacrificed nothing. Each   response underscored Hillary Clinton’s attack on his temperament and qualifications to serve as   . In the middle of his own circular firing squad, Trump decided to shoot at the one unifying Republican who has politely ignored his insanity: House speaker Paul Ryan. Trump’s support for Ryan’s primary opponent was  —   like the construction of so many hideous Trump Towers  —   wholly unnecessary. Ryan’s response was to send out a fundraising email assuming Trump had already blown this election. “If we fail to protect our majority in Congress, we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check,” the fundraiser said, echoing the congressional Republican party’s abandonment of Bob Dole in the closing weeks of the 1996 election.  Of course, these aren’t the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump could yet turn around his national polling deficit of up to 14 points. He could flip the polls in Florida (down four) Michigan (down nine) Pennsylvania (down 13) and New Hampshire (down 15). He could turn Georgia and Utah back into reliably Republican states again, instead of being   states.  But Trump only has one shot left to do that: the TV debates that start in another seven weeks. At the same time, history suggests that   polling is remarkably stable stretching all the way into the final days of an election. It’s going to be a long, hot summer for the orange one.",what accomplish week whatev come close donald trump trump demolish campaign brand parti squander pick convent sever battleground state along pick sever fight could show sign learn failur would tempt anoth week bizarr life republican presidenti nomine thi week decis turn point elect remark campaign supposedli volatil fact volatil unpredict elect come poll vote charact singl donald trump real surpris constant contest trump primari poll begin never lost lead surpris chatter class defi certainti would lose that certainti found noth relat poll data rather sheer disgust disbelief trump polit have defi expect trump suppos abl defi poll graviti forev that would strang conclus draw primari echo trump campaign new anchor greta susteren distil posit thursday quizz karl rove ralli poll number slip poll said sure accur poll rove challeng new elect desk call elect obama incredul assum first poll reliabl second better test size crowd get ralli enthusiast explain would remind close day presidenti campaign walter mondal draw larg enthusiast ralli went narrowli state delic difficult moment educ donald trump candid lead everi stump speech brag poll number less less materi everi ergo poll like media clinton democraci must crook would nice call logic fallaci word never place within physic proxim donald trump great poll told ralli virginia tuesday angel time came ahead four five point think poll know there someth poll there someth phoni that told voter even bigger problem confound elect afraid elect go rig told voter ohio honest those live world easier time understand trump challeng simpler explan lose perform person say goe campaign like fish head thi stink alreadi start august barack obama diplomat press confer trump point elect end lose know mayb rais question obama ventur that seem case moment campaign cycl period dynam turn decis direct while dynam shift cycl run cours fewer fewer opportun georg bush engin shift convent turn deficit lead back devast bill clinton enjoy shift ross perot initi drop race clinton never realli lost lead john kerri stage decent convent held narrow lead soon destroy better republican convent attack follow four year later barack obama buri john mccain financi collaps follow convent past week compar moment recent presidenti histori pretti favor trump miser misjudg disput gold star parent fallen american soldier humayun khan muslim drove wedg republican leader publicli toler nomin serious undermin brand patriot nation well parti reput strength nation secur last impact trump disastr week came echo democrat convent each round disput khan famili serv reinforc critic sacrif noth each respons underscor hillari clinton attack tempera qualif serv middl circular fire squad trump decid shoot unifi republican polit ignor insan hous speaker paul ryan trump support ryan primari oppon like construct mani hideou trump tower wholli unnecessari ryan respons send fundrais email assum trump alreadi blown elect fail protect major congress could hand presid hillari clinton blank check fundrais said echo congression republican parti abandon dole close week elect cours close week campaign trump could turn around nation poll deficit point could flip poll florida four michigan nine pennsylvania hampshir could turn georgia utah back reliabl republican state instead state trump shot left debat start anoth seven week time histori suggest poll remark stabl stretch final day elect go long summer orang
23,"Dave Mirra had brain trauma disease CTE when he died, doctors say","Dave Mirra, the BMX icon who killed himself in February aged 41, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the chronic brain disease that has been found in dozens of former NFL players, a University of Toronto doctor has concluded. Several other neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis, according to ESPN. Mirra is the first BMX rider to be diagnosed with CTE, a disease tied to repeated brain trauma and associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. Mirra was found dead in Greenville, South Carolina on 4 February from a   gunshot wound. The tau protein deposits found in Mirra’s brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr   Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. “I couldn’t tell the difference,” she said. “The trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma. It’s assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before. ” Mirra, a BMX legend who won numerous X Games gold medals, fractured his skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he tried boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during a glittering career. Many in BMX have shared their concerns over the effects of the concussions most riders have sustained at some point in their career. Hazrati shared her findings on Mirra’s brain with additional US and Canadian neuropathologists. Each confirmed Hazrati’s diagnosis of CTE. “It validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,” Hazrati said. “The key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this. ” Mirra’s wife Lauren was told of Mirra’s CTE in March. She told ESPN how she noticed his personality change in the last year of his life. “I started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,” she said. “He wasn’t able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, ‘Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?’ “This is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, let’s do all of the above. ” Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on 11 June. He will also be honored during this June’s X Games in Austin, Texas, with a new event named for him, the Dave Mirra BMX Park Best Trick competition. The winner will be awarded the Mirra Golden Pedal and prize money.

24,Forget Gary Johnson. Trump’s presidency would be one long ’Aleppo moment’,"What does Gary Johnson know? After yet another easily avoidable televised blunder in which the Libertarian presidential candidate failed to name even one leader of a foreign country that he was fond of, it’s a fair question. If, by some miracle, Johnson were able to cobble together enough support to reach the 15% threshold to qualify for the debates, that would be the only question I would want answered. Just two minutes of Johnson rattling off things he does know. How many eggs in a dozen? That’s a snap, Anderson. It’s 12. Where are babies made, Mr Johnson? Well . .. something about mommies and daddies loving each other, right? Who let the dogs out? Wow, that’s a tough one, Anderson. Can I get back to you after I consult with my advisors? I happen to be heavily courting the dogcatchers’ union. Better yet, this could make a remarkable game show for those lonely summer months when the American broadcast networks air human dart tossing and Family Feud. I’m certain that Are You Smarter Than Gary Johnson would be a smash hit on Fox or The CW. Corral some    and see if they can spot China on a map before Gary. If one of the schoolchildren is successful, they get to debate Trump and Clinton in his place. If you think it’s scary that a presidential candidate polling around 8% nationally can’t identify the name of the city undergoing one of the most horrendous humanitarian crises of the last 30 years and is incapable of recalling any of America’s numerous foreign allies, you are not alone. If you see my hypothetical game show in which prepubescent moppets are more aware of global affairs than Gary Johnson, remember we have a   game show host running for president. Donald Trump, a man who is happy to admit he doesn’t read, may become our   . If he does, these   “Aleppo moments” will become a daily fixture in our lives. What does Donald Trump know about the European Union besides cheeky Brexit slogans,   twit Boris Johnson and where the nearest former Soviet bloc beauty pageant is? Oh right, he doesn’t even know that Belgium is a country, not a city.  Why, then, does the media treat Gary Johnson with indifference mixed with condescension while happily cutting into regularly scheduled programming in order to broadcast Trump’s announcement that after eight years, he can finally accept all the clear evidence that Barack Obama was born in the United States?  It should give us all pause that Gary Johnson and Donald Trump, while a great distance apart in the charisma department, are equally as unqualified to be president. In the most terrifying election of my lifetime, we must face   the system we’ve created. It’s one that rewards sloganeering, platitudes and retweets. It’s one where regurgitating promises  —   lower taxes, crushing Isis, legal weed!  —   is all one needs to rally voters. Everything Clintonites accused Bernie Sanders of  —       ideas, lack of foreign policy experience simple solutions to complex problems  —   is actually true of Johnson and Trump. And there’s also Jill Stein, whose campaign currently consists of reminders that she’s sort of like Bernie Sanders, complete with her own stash of “dank memes”.  A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a man who has proven on more than one occasion that he knows very little about the rest of the world, who gets indignant when he is challenged on that fact and who has seemingly made no effort to close this knowledge gap. A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a less hateful Donald Trump  —   a man who looks more like a game show contestant than a game show host. If that’s what you’re looking for in this election, then you’re in luck. If you are, then my one question to you is: why?",what gari johnson know after anoth easili avoid televis blunder libertarian presidenti candid fail name even leader foreign countri fond fair question miracl johnson abl cobbl togeth enough support reach threshold qualifi debat would question would want answer just minut johnson rattl thing know mani egg dozen that snap anderson where babi made johnson well someth mommi daddi love right dog tough anderson back consult advisor happen heavili court dogcatch union better could make remark game show lone summer month american broadcast network human dart toss famili feud certain smarter than gari johnson would smash corral spot china gari schoolchildren success debat trump clinton place think scari presidenti candid poll around nation identifi name citi undergo horrend humanitarian crise last year incap recal america numer foreign alli alon hypothet game show prepubesc moppet awar global affair gari johnson rememb game show host run presid donald trump happi admit read becom aleppo moment becom daili fixtur live what donald trump know european union besid cheeki brexit slogan twit bori johnson nearest former soviet bloc beauti pageant right even know belgium countri citi media treat gari johnson indiffer mix condescens happili cut regularli schedul program order broadcast trump announc eight year final accept clear evid barack obama born unit state give paus gari johnson donald trump great distanc apart charisma depart equal unqualifi presid terrifi elect lifetim must face system creat reward slogan platitud retweet regurgit promis lower tax crush isi legal weed need ralli voter everyth clintonit accus berni sander idea lack foreign polici experi simpl solut complex problem actual true johnson trump also jill stein whose campaign current consist remind sort like berni sander complet stash dank meme vote gari johnson vote proven occas know littl rest world get indign challeng fact seemingli made effort close knowledg vote gari johnson vote less hate donald trump look like game show contest game show host look elect luck question
25,"Elon Musk’s self-driving evangelism masks risk of Tesla autopilot, experts say","Elon Musk’s rockets usually do not stray beyond Earth’s orbit, but that hasn’t stopped him from making promises about Mars. The Tesla CEO’s wild, ambitious futurism has earned him billions of dollars, fawning coverage from the tech press, and a subreddit devoted entirely to discussion of his divinity. But it has also now landed him and his company in the awkward position of explaining why a feature they called “autopilot” should not be to blame for failing to prevent one of their vehicles from driving under a truck in May, killing    Joshua Brown  —   the first known fatality involving a   car. Brown was a Tesla enthusiast with a “need for speed” according to reports by the Associated Press. He had previously posted a video to YouTube of the vehicle avoiding an accident while in autopilot mode, which Musk retweeted. In a blog post on Thursday about the incident, Tesla said: “Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. ” The driver of the truck told the AP that he heard a Harry Potter movie being played from the wreck of the car, and the Florida sheriff’s department confirmed that a portable DVD player was found in the car, though it is still not known whether Brown was watching a film at the time of the crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the accident. Since Tesla launched Autopilot’s enhanced cruise control features in October 2014  —   and especially since Autopilot was updated to include   capability in October 2015  —   the company has been careful to stress that drivers remain responsible  —   and liable  —   for any collisions. The company pointed out that this was the first fatal accident in 130m miles driven by all Tesla cars under the control of the autopilot feature, compared with a US average of one fatality every 94m miles. It also pointed out that autopilot is still in a “public beta” phase. But other companies have chosen more conservative descriptions for their assisted cruise control. Volvo calls its current features “  tech” or “park assist pilot” which analysts say are more accurate descriptors than the “autopilot” term Tesla uses. Mercedes calls its package “driver assistance” and “drive pilot” Toyota has a “safety sense” feature, and Honda calls it “sensing”. The fine print of the Tesla Model S owner’s manual includes disclaimers for all manner of conditions and scenarios  —   including heavy rain, snow, fog, and direct sunlight  —   that appear to include the circumstances of the 7 May accident. But in January, just a few months after he chastised drivers for “some fairly crazy videos on YouTube” of   hijinks, Musk told reporters that the Model S was “probably better than humans at this point in highway driving”. Before the updated autopilot was released, he said that the car was “almost able to go [between San Francisco and Seattle] without touching the controls at all”. In April, he distracted fans and reporters from the news of a recall of 2, 700 Model X SUVs with a joking tweet comparing autopilot to the video game Mario Kart. Talulah Riley, Musk’s wife, shared and deleted an Instagram video of herself driving on the highway between Los Angeles and San Diego without holding the wheel. Many of Tesla’s current owners are tech enthusiasts who are eager to try out the most   vehicles. And when Musk products are presented as the forefront of the “autonomous revolution” the perception of some of those drivers is, “I’m already there. I’m already living it,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. Far from being “there” however, Tesla’s   technology is in what Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, called “the ‘mushy middle’ of the automation spectrum”  —   where   driving is increasing in scope but is not yet capable of replacing the driver completely. Smith, who specializes in the legal ramifications of autonomous cars, said that this middle ground has unique dangers: “The difficulty comes if [issues the computer can’t handle] happen so infrequently. Say it can do 99% but not 100%  —   then people are not ready for the 1%. We see problems of  . People get bored, they start texting or watching a DVD. ” Smith warned against reading too much into this single instance or blaming Tesla, pointing out that there is already “carnage” on American roads which kills 100 people every day. “We don’t know how many of those could have been prevented if those vehicles had automatic braking, or a Tesla Autopilot system. ” However Brauer said it was time for Musk to shift his messaging to clearly acknowledge the limitations of the cars. “These are not   cars. They are driver assist features. Honda and Toyota have been really clear about that from day one . .. It really is important. ” Brauer said Musk’s colorful remarks about the technology often present an exaggerated and dangerous image of the vehicles’ capabilities. “There’s been potentially mixed messages between a disclaimer in the car that says you’ve got to be alert the whole time and this thing is being beta tested, and then his comment that the car is probably better than humans. ” The term “autopilot” draws a dangerous link to flying, said Mary “Missy” Cummings, a Duke University robotics professor and former military pilot. “Most car companies love to equate the driving experience with a cool flying experience   …     but they need to step away from that parallel,” said Cummings, who has been outspoken about the dangers of   cars and the need for tighter restrictions. “I get to fly a fighter jet, because I’m highly trained,” she said. “This accident really highlights the fact that people do not understand the capabilities and limitations of these vehicles. ” For now, the crash makes it clear that Tesla should shut off its autopilot feature for certain   driving on freeways, said Cummings. “Either fix it or turn it off . .. The car was in a place where the computer was blind. The computer couldn’t see the environment for what it was. ” Some experts, however, said the reality is that humans often fail to follow safety recommendations and tend to do a poor job at perceiving risk. “That’s not a judgment on any individual. That’s human nature. This could be anyone of us,” said Don MacKenzie, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. Ragunathan Rajkumar, professor at the engineering department of of Carnegie Mellon university, agreed. “The question is whether the humans read, understand, and follow what is said on the screen, which I think most people tend to ignore pretty quickly,” he said. “The other issue is that we humans tend to be overconfident with something based on limited experience. ” He pointed to the video Brown posted, in which the system avoided a collision, as potential evidence that Brown had become “overconfident” in the system’s abilities. “He said ‘this did something good for me, so it will be reliable and good for me in every other context’. This leap in confidence comes naturally to humans, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the technology will work in every situation,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a weakness in how humans think. ” Representatives for Tesla declined to comment further.",elon musk rocket usual stray beyond earth orbit stop make promis mar tesla wild ambiti futur earn billion dollar fawn coverag tech press subreddit devot entir discuss divin also land compani awkward posit explain featur call autopilot blame fail prevent vehicl drive truck kill joshua brown first known fatal involv brown tesla enthusiast need speed accord report associ press previous post video youtub vehicl avoid accid autopilot mode musk retweet blog post thursday incid tesla said neither autopilot driver notic white side tractor trailer brightli brake appli driver truck told heard harri potter movi play wreck florida sheriff depart confirm portabl player found though still known whether brown watch film time crash nation highway traffic safeti administr investig accid sinc tesla launch autopilot enhanc cruis control featur octob especi sinc autopilot updat includ capabl octob compani care stress driver remain respons liabl collis compani point first fatal accid mile driven tesla car control autopilot featur compar averag fatal everi mile also point autopilot still public beta phase compani chosen conserv descript assist cruis control volvo call current featur tech park assist pilot analyst accur descriptor autopilot term tesla use merced call packag driver assist drive pilot toyota safeti sens featur honda call sens fine print tesla model owner manual includ disclaim manner condit scenario includ heavi rain snow direct sunlight appear includ circumst accid januari month chastis driver fairli crazi video youtub hijink musk told report model probabl better human point highway drive befor updat autopilot releas said almost abl francisco seattl without touch control april distract fan report news recal model suv joke tweet compar autopilot video game mario kart talulah riley musk wife share delet instagram video drive highway angel diego without hold wheel mani tesla current owner tech enthusiast eager vehicl musk product present forefront autonom revolut percept driver alreadi alreadi live said karl brauer senior analyst kelley blue book automot research compani howev tesla technolog bryant walker smith assist professor engin univers south carolina call mushi middl autom spectrum drive increas scope capabl replac driver complet smith special legal ramif autonom car said middl ground uniqu danger difficulti come issu comput handl happen infrequ peopl readi problem peopl bore start text watch smith warn read much singl instanc blame tesla point alreadi carnag american road kill peopl everi know mani could prevent vehicl automat brake tesla autopilot system howev brauer said time musk shift messag clearli acknowledg limit car these car they driver assist featur honda toyota realli clear realli import brauer said musk color remark technolog often present exagger danger imag vehicl capabl there potenti mix messag disclaim say alert whole time thing beta test comment probabl better human term autopilot draw danger link fli said mari missi cum duke univers robot professor former militari pilot most compani love equat drive experi cool fli experi need step away parallel said cum outspoken danger car need tighter restrict fighter highli train said thi accid realli highlight fact peopl understand capabl limit vehicl crash make clear tesla shut autopilot featur certain drive freeway said cum either turn place comput blind comput environ some expert howev said realiti human often fail follow safeti recommend tend poor perceiv risk that judgment individu that human natur thi could anyon said mackenzi professor civil environment engin univers washington ragunathan rajkumar professor engin depart carnegi mellon univers agre question whether human read understand follow said screen think peopl tend ignor pretti quickli said issu human tend overconfid someth base limit experi point video brown post system avoid collis potenti evid brown becom overconfid system abil said someth good reliabl good everi context thi leap confid come natur human necessarili mean technolog work everi situat rajkumar said weak human think repres tesla declin comment
26,"Twitter to conclude sale negotiations this month, sources say","Twitter has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about a sale by the time it reports   earnings on 27 October, according to people familiar with the matter.  The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company’s future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people familiar with the matter said this week. Salesforce is in the running, while Disney and Google’s parent company Alphabet have also been contemplating bids, the sources added.  It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment.  With Salesforce, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming.  Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313m average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.  The company missed Wall Street’s sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.  It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Snapchat and Facebook’s Instagram. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly.  Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as CEO more than a year ago, has been part of Disney’s board since 2013.  Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.",twitter told potenti acquir seek conclud negoti sale time report earn octob accord peopl familiar matter timelin huge ambiti context merger acquisit given twitter began mull sale last month clearest sign jack dorsey push provid clariti sharehold employe compani futur quickli possibl bind acquisit offer next week twitter alreadi whittl field potenti acquir peopl familiar matter said week salesforc run disney googl parent compani alphabet also contempl bid sourc ad certain process result sale sourc caution sourc ask identifi matter confidenti twitter salesforc declin comment disney googl return request comment with salesforc twitter might turn focu custom servic commun mine databas tweet busi intellig googl would like interest social news dimens twitter disney contrast might expand reach sport entertain program twitter struggl gener revenu growth profit despit averag monthli activ user grow presenc sourc news compani miss wall street sale expect first second quarter accord thomson reuter starmin produc profit quarter public compani also fail keep pace rival notabl snapchat facebook instagram both boast user twitter measur even though much newer advertis begun migrat dollar accordingli dorsey return twitter year part disney board sinc twitter went public novemb share share peak month steadi downward trajectori sinc
27,Is our world a simulation? Why some scientists say it’s more likely than not,"When Elon Musk isn’t outlining plans to use his massive rocket to leave a decaying Planet Earth and colonize Mars, he sometimes talks about his belief that Earth isn’t even real and we probably live in a computer simulation. “There’s a billion to one chance we’re living in base reality,” he said at a conference in June. Musk is just one of the people in Silicon Valley to take a keen interest in the “simulation hypothesis” which argues that what we experience as reality is actually a giant computer simulation created by a more sophisticated intelligence. If it sounds a lot like The Matrix, that’s because it is. According to this week’s New Yorker profile of Y Combinator venture capitalist Sam Altman, there are two tech billionaires secretly engaging scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. But what does this mean? And what evidence is there that we are, in fact, living in The Matrix? One popular argument for the simulation hypothesis, outside of acid trips, came from Oxford University’s Nick Bostrom in 2003 (although the idea dates back as far as the   philosopher René Descartes). In a paper titled “Are You Living In a Simulation?” Bostrom suggested that members of an advanced “posthuman” civilization with vast computing power might choose to run simulations of their ancestors in the universe. This argument is extrapolated from observing current trends in technology, including the rise of virtual reality and efforts to map the human brain. If we believe that there is nothing supernatural about what causes consciousness and it’s merely the product of a very complex architecture in the human brain, we’ll be able to reproduce it. “Soon there will be nothing technical standing in the way to making machines that have their own consciousness,” said Rich Terrile, a scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. At the same time, videogames are becoming more and more sophisticated and in the future we’ll be able to have simulations of conscious entities inside them. “Forty years ago we had Pong  —   two rectangles and a dot. That’s where we were. Now 40 years later, we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year. And soon we’ll have virtual reality, we’ll have augmented reality,” said Musk. “If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality. ” It’s a view shared by Terrile. “If one progresses at the current rate of technology a few decades into the future, very quickly we will be a society where there are artificial entities living in simulations that are much more abundant than human beings. ” If there are many more simulated minds than organic ones, then the chances of us being among the real minds starts to look more and more unlikely. As Terrile puts it: “If in the future there are more digital people living in simulated environments than there are today, then what is to say we are not part of that already?” Reasons to believe that the universe is a simulation include the fact that it behaves mathematically and is broken up into pieces (subatomic particles) like a pixelated video game. “Even things that we think of as continuous  —   time, energy, space, volume  —   all have a finite limit to their size. If that’s the case, then our universe is both computable and finite. Those properties allow the universe to be simulated,” Terrile said. “Quite frankly, if we are not living in a simulation, it is an extraordinarily unlikely circumstance,” he added. So who has created this simulation? “Our future selves,” said Terrile. Not everyone is so convinced by the hypothesis. “Is it logically possible that we are in a simulation? Yes. Are we probably in a simulation? I would say no,” said Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at MIT. “In order to make the argument in the first place, we need to know what the fundamental laws of physics are where the simulations are being made. And if we are in a simulation then we have no clue what the laws of physics are. What I teach at MIT would be the simulated laws of physics,” he said. Harvard theoretical physicist Lisa Randall is even more skeptical. “I don’t see that there’s really an argument for it,” she said. “There’s no real evidence. ” “It’s also a lot of hubris to think we would be what ended up being simulated. ”  Terrile believes that recognizing that we are probably living in a simulation is as   as Copernicus realizing that the Earth was not the center of the universe. “It was such a profound idea that it wasn’t even thought of as an assumption,” he said. Before Copernicus, scientists had tried to explain the peculiar behaviour of the planets’ motion with complex mathematical models. “When they dropped the assumption, everything else became much simpler to understand. ” That we might be in a simulation is, Terrile argues, a simpler explanation for our existence than the idea that we are the first generation to rise up from primordial ooze and evolve into molecules, biology and eventually intelligence and  . The simulation hypothesis also accounts for peculiarities in quantum mechanics, particularly the measurement problem, whereby things only become defined when they are observed. “For decades it’s been a problem. Scientists have bent over backwards to eliminate the idea that we need a conscious observer. Maybe the real solution is you do need a conscious entity like a conscious player of a video game,” he said. For Tegmark, this doesn’t make sense. “We have a lot of problems in physics and we can’t blame our failure to solve them on simulation. ” How can the hypothesis be put to the test? On one hand, neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers can check whether it’s possible to simulate the human mind. So far, machines have proven to be good at playing chess and Go and putting captions on images. But can a machine achieve consciousness? We don’t know.  On the other hand, scientists can look for hallmarks of simulation. “Suppose someone is simulating our universe  —   it would be very tempting to cut corners in ways that makes the simulation cheaper to run. You could look for evidence of that in an experiment,” said Tegmark.  For Terrile, the simulation hypothesis has “beautiful and profound” implications. First, it provides a scientific basis for some kind of afterlife or larger domain of reality above our world. “You don’t need a miracle, faith or anything special to believe it. It comes naturally out of the laws of physics,” he said. Second, it means we will soon have the same ability to create our own simulations.  “We will have the power of mind and matter to be able to create whatever we want and occupy those worlds. ”",when elon musk outlin plan massiv rocket leav decay planet earth colon mar sometim talk belief earth even real probabl live comput simul there billion chanc live base realiti said confer june musk peopl silicon valley take keen interest simul hypothesi argu experi realiti actual giant comput simul creat sophist intellig sound like matrix accord week yorker profil combin ventur capitalist altman tech billionair secretli engag scientist work break simul mean evid fact live matrix popular argument simul hypothesi outsid acid trip came oxford univers nick bostrom although idea date back philosoph descart paper titl live simul bostrom suggest member advanc posthuman civil vast comput power might choos simul ancestor univers thi argument extrapol observ current trend technolog includ rise virtual realiti effort human brain believ noth supernatur caus conscious mere product complex architectur human brain abl reproduc soon noth technic stand make machin conscious said rich terril scientist nasa propuls laboratori time videogam becom sophist futur abl simul consciou entiti insid forti year pong rectangl that year later photorealist simul million peopl play simultan get better everi year soon virtual realiti augment realiti said musk assum rate improv game becom indistinguish realiti view share terril progress current rate technolog decad futur quickli societi artifici entiti live simul much abund human be mani simul mind organ one chanc among real mind start look unlik terril put futur digit peopl live simul environ today part alreadi reason believ univers simul includ fact behav mathemat broken piec subatom particl like pixel video game even thing think continu time energi space volum finit limit size case univers comput finit those properti allow univers simul terril said quit frankli live simul extraordinarili unlik circumst ad creat simul futur selv said terril everyon convinc hypothesi logic possibl simul probabl simul would said tegmark professor physic order make argument first place need know fundament law physic simul made simul clue law physic what teach would simul law physic said harvard theoret physicist lisa randal even skeptic realli argument said there real evid also hubri think would end simul terril believ recogn probabl live simul copernicu realiz earth center univers profound idea even thought assumpt said befor copernicu scientist tri explain peculiar behaviour planet motion complex mathemat model when drop assumpt everyth els becam much simpler understand that might simul terril argu simpler explan exist idea first gener rise primordi ooz evolv molecul biolog eventu intellig simul hypothesi also account peculiar quantum mechan particularli measur problem wherebi thing becom defin observ decad problem scientist bent backward elimin idea need consciou observ mayb real solut need consciou entiti like consciou player video game said tegmark make sens problem physic blame failur solv simul hypothesi test hand neuroscientist artifici intellig research check whether possibl simul human mind machin proven good play chess put caption imag machin achiev conscious know hand scientist look hallmark simul suppos someon simul univers would tempt corner way make simul cheaper could look evid experi said tegmark terril simul hypothesi beauti profound implic first provid scientif basi kind afterlif larger domain realiti world need miracl faith anyth special believ come natur law physic said second mean soon abil creat simul power mind matter abl creat whatev want occupi world
28,The economists’ guide to choosing between Trump and Clinton,"The parties have spoken and after a brutal campaign season, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now the official presidential candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties. Now the real fight begins, and the economy will be a key  —   if not the key —   battleground. More than 90% of voters have said that the economy is extremely important to them. The Guardian asked three economists to weigh in on what we can expect from a Trump or Clinton White House. Here is what they had to say: Normal presidential candidates put forth proposals that usually have been vetted by policy experts. They also generally have track records from their time as elected officials. The combination of these factors allows external observers to make   predictions on what policies might get adopted if they get elected and to then speculate on how those policies might affect the economy. Trump is not a normal candidate. To be generous, his views on major economic issues are eclectic. He promises a big tax cut, but it’s probably not very serious since he has no concomitant plan to restrain the growth of government spending. He threatens to impose steep tariffs, which would risk triggering a trade war, but he claims protectionism would merely be a stick to extort concessions from trading partners. He makes noises about potentially defaulting on debt but then pivots and says the debt can be financed by printing money. It’s not clear which would be the frying pan and which would be the fire, but either approach causes angst among most economists. And we can’t forget Trump’s signature issue of immigration. Tougher border enforcement generates a lot of debate about whether America benefits from more   labor, but that controversy would seem minor if Trump actually launched a campaign to locate and deport the    people who already are in the country illegally. With all this uncertainty about what Trump really believes, it’s impossible to guess which policies will change and how the economy would be impacted. For what it’s worth, libertarians generally fear that Trump ultimately would govern as a   populist. Though a Trump victory presumably would mean continued Republican control of the House and Senate, so it would be interesting to see whether traditional Republicans in Congress (who claim to believe in smaller government) would be able to control their seemingly uncontrollable leader. Daniel Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. He specializes in fiscal policy, particularly tax reform, international tax competition, and the economic burden of government spending. The most pressing problem in America today remains skyrocketing inequality. If trends since 2010 prevail, by 2018 the income share of the top 1% will be 23. 7% the highest level that figure has reached since the eve of the Great Depression in America. Reining in the growth of inequality is a multifaceted project of decades that requires higher wages, stronger unions, public investments in infrastructure and education from   to  . It’s hard to imagine any president implementing such an ambitious agenda by 2018. There is one concrete policy change that can be achieved by 2018, which is the crucial first step to finance the investments needed to achieve more broadly shared prosperity in America  —   higher taxes on the top 1%.  The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the plans of all three remaining presidential candidates and concluded that the Sanders tax plan would raise the average tax rate on the top 1% to 55. 4% under the Clinton plan it would rise 3. 4 points to 36. 2% and under the Trump plan it would fall 11. 7 points to 21. 8%. By moving in the wrong direction, the Trump plan would accelerate the growth in the income share of the top 1% as the Bush tax cuts did in the early 2000s and by 2018 drive inequality in America to the highest level on record. Both the Clinton and Sanders plans would move decisively in the direction of reducing inequality with the divide between the two plans, like the divide between their passionate supporters, reflecting not as much a differing direction as a differing scope of their ambitions.  Mark Price is a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center. The net effect of Trump’s program will be to cause considerable economic disruption but little if any net gain in employment or output, even while raising the risk of a major economic crisis. Trump proposes to lower taxes and to reduce business regulation and foreign competition for American businesses and jobs. While raising income for the rich, the tax cuts will do little to promote economic growth   has been tried repeatedly over the past 35 years and does little to stimulate the economy, especially in a depressed economy where people and businesses save tax cuts rather than invest or spend. While high tariffs on Chinese or Mexican imports would shift some production to domestic suppliers, the effect will be muted because footloose suppliers will move to other sources not facing the tariffs. Any gains from reduced imports will also be offset by losses among American export industries, such as high technology, entertainment and business services.  Similarly, if undocumented workers are repatriated, it would open some jobs but the net effect will be small and may not even be positive. Many positions vacated by repatriated immigrants will stay vacant for lack of willing workers, and any gains must be balanced when businesses fail because they have lost immigrant labor. The Trump fiscal policy will have some stimulative effect increased economic activity will come from increased spending building walls, and on immigration and customs enforcement and the military.  Any economic growth from the Trump trade and fiscal policies must be balanced by reduced investment due to increased uncertainty coming from his aggressive foreign policy, and the danger that reducing financial market regulation will open the door to misbehavior like that which brought on the crisis in 2007 to 2009. Fear and disruption will discourage investment, reducing employment and output. And reductions in employment will be particularly hard on workers because Trump plans further cuts in the social safety net. While he is pledged to maintain social security retirement and Medicare benefits, he has proposed putting time limits and further restrictions on other programs, including unemployment insurance and supplemental nutrition (food stamps). Should the economy face a major recession, cutbacks in these social insurance programs will further compound the economic downturn. Gerald Friedman is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  There’s no mystery about the fact that she would move public policy incrementally to the left. Some tax increases, but not giant tax increases. Some new regulations, but not complete government takeovers of industry. A bigger burden of government spending, but not turning America into Greece. An increase in the minimum wage, but not up to $15 an hour. More subsidies for higher education, but not an entitlement for everyone. And some restrictions on trade, but no sweeping reversal of the   consensus that has existed since the second world war. And, needless to say, she won’t support the types of entitlement reforms that have attracted support in the   House and   Senate. Then again, she says she will have her husband serve as some sort of economic czar. And given Bill Clinton’s   record, that implies a more centrist approach and an ability to strike big deals with congressional Republicans. It’s just a guess, but incremental leftism almost certainly will characterize a Clinton presidency, which presumably means a continuation of the current weak economic expansion. Though everything written about Clinton is speculative because we don’t know whether she will have sufficient coattails to help congressional Democrats regain control of the House and Senate.  —    Mitchell, While Clinton would do little to change the direction of the economy, her program will raise employment a little while improving wages and living conditions for working people, especially women, and those in families with young children and those still without health insurance. Clinton has proposed to continue the economic policies of the Obama Administration including its support for free trade and a    for undocumented immigrants, as well as advocating Obama proposal for an increase in the minimum wage (in her case to $ ) as well as small tax increases on the very rich, on large estates, and on financial institutions. Were these to be enacted, it would raise wages for as many as 40 million workers and narrow somewhat the gap between rich and poor. (The increase in the minimum wage would help some workers and would push up effective demand slightly, but its impact would be muted by the enactment of higher state minimum wages elsewhere, including in California and New York.)  She has also proposed increase access to community colleges, expand family leave and childcare, and provide more access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act these programs would provide real gains for millions of middle income working people. Perhaps the most significant Clinton proposals are in the regulation of financial markets, a major source of the economic crisis of 2007 to 2009. Clinton favors strong enforcement of   and would go further in regulating banks and financial markets to reduce the use of risky financial vehicles. Increased regulation and taxation of risky activities by banks and other financial institutions might also help the economy by reducing the risk of a major financial meltdown. By reducing fear of financial market collapse, tighter regulation may also encourage greater investment, stimulating employment and economic growth.  —   Friedman",parti spoken brutal campaign season

29,Conventional thinking will not solve the climate crisis,"The good news   according to the World Energy Council (WEC)   is that, per person, our energy demand is set to peak before 2030. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of “unprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies”.  The bad news is that under the scenarios drawn up by the WEC, even keeping to the upper target agreed in Paris of global warming no greater than 2C will require an “exceptional and enduring effort” that goes beyond any current commitments and needs a price for coal, oil and gas that is dramatically higher.  To sweeten this pill, the WEC gives its scenarios names which must appear funky in the world of energy policy. “Modern jazz” is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic “Unfinished symphony” is about emerging greener models for growth, while “Hard rock” is a future of both low and grubby growth. The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin. Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre. Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable. It must be met, and the only question is how.  Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years. There is no sign yet of the ferocious challenge to neoliberal orthodoxy happening at the margins of economics shaping mainstream visions of our possible futures. The merest glance at the history of changing ideas suggests this is  . There are reasons why we need to get a move on with tackling energy demand. Extreme weather events abound. Record flooding in North Carolina in the United States follows record flooding in Louisiana earlier in the year. While no individual event can be described a direct cause and effect relationship, increasingly heavy rainfall and flood events are consistent with climate models for a warming world. It’s nearly a year on from the wettest UK December on record in 2015. Subsequently, work by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the odds for that rainfall event were increased by  % by climate change.  Now, insurers in the UK complain that householders are failing to protect their properties from flooding, while the Environment Agency says that insurers preside over a system in which risk is simply rebuilt where flooding has already taken place. The Climate Change Committee says the UK is off track to meet its   carbon reduction target, just as key decisions on aviation expansion and fracking look set to lock in   infrastructure.  Scenarios for industrial transition are needed that tell a bolder and more convincing tale, not just of the UK meeting its international obligations that are written into treaties, but that go further and stand a genuine chance of limiting warming to 2C. What sort of scenarios should we be looking at then? We can learn from the impoverished Brexit debate that was marred by binary choices cloaked in wilful misinformation. For the whole population to fully understand our options, and the choices and challenges embedded in them, we should be thinking as openly and broadly as possible. We can look at how far   will get us, and at the maximum speed and scale of change that market mechanisms and the pricing of carbon are likely to deliver. In both, the different impacts on rich and poor need assessing.  But we should go further to assess the pros and cons of radical scenarios for changing how we live and work. Rarely considered but important variables come from new economics, including the shorter working week, the share economy, shifts in corporate ownership and governance, and intelligent but deliberate measures for economic localisation. Compare these to the “stumble on” or business as usual scenario, in which we give up control of our future to a permanently destabilised climate change, but also assess seriously the consequences of the argument for planned   “ ” of the economy. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government promised to “go beyond the conventional thinking” to put things right. It never did, but with the climate crisis there is no choice. Conventional thinking is   and contradictory. Without a balanced, comparative assessment of strategies to align energy use and industry with inescapable climate action, we won’t be able to choose the best possible future. I’m glad to say that work like this is beginning to happen at places such as the University of Leeds’ centre for industrial energy, materials and products.

30,Sloppy England earn point in Slovenia thanks to Joe Hart’s stunning saves,"Gareth Southgate has had two games in charge for England and, though no one could have seriously expected him to remove all the team’s imperfections in that time, it still cannot be satisfactory that it is so difficult to see even the first flickers of improvement. They were poor again here in Ljubljana and fortunate, in the extreme, that Southgate did not have to reflect on England’s first defeat in a qualifying fixture for seven years. For that, they were indebted to Joe Hart in a match when he reminded us that, on form, he still has games when he can legitimately claim to be one of the best in the business. England were alarmingly susceptible in defence. They rarely passed the ball with any authority and there was absolutely no sense of a group of players desperately trying to impress a new manager. Southgate admitted his team had been lucky and it is not easy finding any compelling evidence to advance the case for him getting the job  . Perhaps that is a harsh conclusion when he has just been parachuted into the role at short notice but, Hart aside, it was difficult to identify a single England player who can reflect on a satisfying evening’s work. The performance was a reminder that removing Wayne Rooney from the starting lineup will not automatically fix this team and, once again, there were a few boos at the final whistle from England’s fans. That will continue to be the soundtrack for as long as England continue to put in these kinds of dishevelled displays. Jesse Lingard and Theo Walcott did little to disprove the theory they were fortunate to be in the team. Daniel Sturridge threatened only sporadically and England’s three shots on target is their lowest in a competitive fixture since playing Costa Rica in the last World Cup. Southgate talked about inheriting “a mess” and the performance left the impression little had changed. His opening line in the   press conference summed it up. “We can play better, for sure,” he said. At least Rooney can still consider himself a favourite of England’s followers. Three days after the Wembley crowd subjected him to minor boos, the first appreciative cry of “Rooney” reverberated round Slovenia’s   stadium within the opening 90 seconds. More notably, there was voluble support for Sam Allardyce, including a loud rendition in the opening few minutes of “Justice for Allardyce” and various other chants making it clear what they thought of the Daily Telegraph investigation that brought him down. If the hardcore fans want Southgate to take charge permanently, this was not an occasion when it became evident. His name was not sung once. Southgate was probably entitled to feel aggrieved about an early attack when Sturridge was knocked over by a Slovenia defender in the penalty area but it would have been misplaced to focus on that moment too much bearing in mind the number of occasions when Hart spared his team. England’s deficiencies first became evident when Eric Dier underhit a backpass in the 10th minute and Hart had to rush from his goalline to block Roman Bezjak’s shot before a second Slovenia attacker, Jasmin Kurtic, curled a   effort against the post. That, however, was far from the only time England found themselves in trouble because of their own carelessness. Gary Cahill, in particular, had a difficult game and could have been sent off for a   challenge on Josep Ilicic late on, leading to a confrontation between Lingard and Aljaz Srtuna. Lingard was defending Marcus Rashford but Southgate was unimpressed and said his player needed to learn some more  . Ilicic created numerous problems for England’s defence but Hart kept him out every time, including one occasion when Jordan Henderson, wearing the captain’s armband with little grace, gave the ball straight to his opponent. Southgate seemed startled by how vulnerable his team were at the back, talking of it being “very much a work in progress”and noting Slovenia’s “opportunities tended to be set pieces or  ”. Twice at the start of the second half, Slovenia had corners from the right and on both occasions Hart denied them with outstanding goalkeeping. The second save, in particular, from Kurtic’s header was the kind of moment to reignite the debate about why Hart is spending the season on loan at Torino. He should never have been exposed so often and Southgate explained that when he brought on Rooney as a   replacement for Sturridge the decision was based on “the need for some experience in there to calm things down”. Slovenia were undoubtedly encouraged by their   win against Slovakia on Saturday but it would still have been reasonable to expect England to play with more control and, though Southgate pointed out it was a difficult playing surface, he did also recognise it was no excuse for the number of times passes were misplaced.",gareth southgat game charg england though could serious expect remov team imperfect time still cannot satisfactori difficult even first flicker improv they poor ljubljana fortun extrem southgat reflect england first defeat qualifi fixtur seven year indebt hart match remind form still game legitim claim best busi england alarmingli suscept defenc they rare pass ball author absolut sens group player desper tri impress manag southgat admit team lucki easi find compel evid advanc case get perhap harsh conclus parachut role short notic hart asid difficult identifi singl england player reflect satisfi even work perform remind remov wayn rooney start lineup automat team boo final whistl england fan that continu soundtrack long england continu kind dishevel display jess lingard theo walcott littl disprov theori fortun team daniel sturridg threaten sporad england three shot target lowest competit fixtur sinc play costa rica last world southgat talk inherit mess perform left impress littl chang open line press confer sum play better sure said least rooney still consid favourit england follow three day wembley crowd subject minor boo first appreci rooney reverber round slovenia stadium within open second more notabl volubl support allardyc includ loud rendit open minut justic allardyc variou chant make clear thought daili telegraph investig brought hardcor fan want southgat take charg perman occas becam evid name sung southgat probabl entitl feel aggriev earli attack sturridg knock slovenia defend penalti area would misplac focu moment much bear mind number occas hart spare team england defici first becam evid eric dier underhit backpass minut hart rush goallin block roman bezjak shot second slovenia attack jasmin kurtic curl effort post that howev time england found troubl careless gari cahil particular difficult game could sent challeng josep ilic late lead confront lingard aljaz srtuna lingard defend marcu rashford southgat unimpress said player need learn ilic creat numer problem england defenc hart kept everi time includ occas jordan henderson wear captain armband littl grace gave ball straight oppon southgat seem startl vulner team back talk much work progress note slovenia opportun tend piec twice start second half slovenia corner right occas hart deni outstand goalkeep second save particular kurtic header kind moment reignit debat hart spend season loan torino never expos often southgat explain brought rooney replac sturridg decis base need experi calm thing slovenia undoubtedli encourag slovakia saturday would still reason expect england play control though southgat point difficult play surfac also recognis excus number time pass misplac
31,Unity at the Republican convention? Forget about it,"Reince Priebus hopes that the convention in Cleveland next week will help unify the GOP. “Given the drama that we’ve had   …     I think now, more than ever, the role of the convention to assist in the unification of the party is going to be extremely important,” the chairman of the Republican National Committee told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel over the Fourth of July weekend. Unfortunately for the chairman, the convention will showcase a Republican party that is about as united as the former Yugoslavia. The best Priebus can hope for is Potemkin displays of unity on stage and no violence off it  —   but even that is not assured. The reality is that over 50% of Republicans, according to a recent Fox News poll, want a different nominee than Donald Trump. An insurgent group of convention delegates are even trying to oust the billionaire real estate mogul as nominee. The last Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, refuses to support Trump. The past two Republican presidents, George W Bush and George HW Bush, will not be coming to the convention and don’t seem to have any interest in endorsing The Donald. The sitting Republican governor of the state the convention is going to be held in, John Kasich of Ohio, has not endorsed Trump either  —   and he seems in no hurry to do so. Politico asked 50 Republican politicians whether they would be interested in speaking at the convention and only a few told the news outlet they would. Many said they weren’t even going to go to the convention. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that it could barely find anyone in Congress willing to speak favorably of the presumptive Republican nominee. “Less than two weeks before the Republican convention, the party’s congressional wing is no more enthusiastic about Donald Trump for president than when he clinched the nomination two months ago,” the story began. Then there is the conservative intellectual establishment, among which Trump is largely reviled (though in some case he is merely despised). The dean of conservative columnists, George Will, even changed his party registration over Trump’s nomination. For Trump’s part, it’s not even clear he wants to unify the party. When Trump came to Capitol Hill last week to meet with Senate Republicans, he called Illinois senator Mark Kirk, who rescinded his endorsement of Trump, a loser. In a testy conservation with Senator Jeff Flake, who has yet to rally behind him, Trump threatened to help defeat the Arizona lawmaker in his   bid. (Flake is not up for   this year.) Trump was more explicit about his view on the importance of unity during a campaign rally in North Carolina last week. “To be honest, I think I win without unity,” he said. “Probably I do better without the support I’m talking about because that’s why I’m here in the first place. ” One of Trump’s most famous surrogates doesn’t seem particularly interested in helping unite the party either. “That gang, they call themselves Never hashtag, whatever, I just call ‘em Republicans Against Trump, or RAT for short,” Sarah Palin said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver last week. So much for unity. Indeed, a   poll released last Wednesday had Trump winning just 70% of the Republican vote in a race against Hillary Clinton. A Raba Research poll released this week was even worse with Trump garnering just 66% of   Republicans. In both polls, Trump was trailing Clinton by either 11 or 12 percentage points, though in fairness to Trump, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Clinton up closer to 4%. Maybe the party will unite as the race moves toward November out of sheer tribalism or fear of Hillary Clinton’s supreme court picks. Then again, given the opportunity last week to use FBI director James Comey’s scathing report on Clinton’s “extremely careless” handling of classified information as secretary of state to rally Republicans, Trump seemed more interested in talking about the finer qualities of Saddam Hussein. So Priebus should forget about the Republican party uniting at the convention. A more reasonable goal might be to prevent unrest. But even that is not a  . Liberal groups have stated their intent to protest in Cleveland. In response, a   group has said it will send representatives to protect Trump supporters from the protesters. That’s a toxic recipe for something, but whatever it is, it sure isn’t unity.

32,"Men who act as breadwinners face negative health effects, study finds","Men who act as the primary breadwinners in their marriages are more likely to face psychological and health hurdles, according to a new study that looks at a potential adverse impact of traditional gender roles.  The study, released on Friday by University of Connecticut sociologists, found that as men take on a greater share of economic responsibility in their marriage, they reported greater strains on their wellbeing and health. In years where men in question were their family’s sole breadwinner, their psychological and health outcomes were at their worst. “Men are expected to be breadwinners, yet providing for one’s family with little or no help has negative repercussions,” said lead author Christin Munsch, professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut. “A lot of what we know about how gender plays out in marriage focuses on the ways in which women are disadvantaged,” she said. “Our study contributes to a growing body of research that demonstrates the ways in which gendered expectations are harmful for men too. ” But the study also looked at women and found a contrasting psychological outcome. For women, taking on a greater financial responsibility in their marriages had positive effects on happiness and wellbeing. “Women . .. may approach breadwinning as an opportunity or choice,” said Munsch, who   the paper with Matthew Rogers and Jessica Yorks, graduate students at the university. “Breadwinning women may feel a sense of pride, without worrying what others will say if they can’t or don’t maintain it. ” “After all, they have accomplished something rare for their gender,” the study says, about women who are their family’s primary breadwinner. “Should they fail to maintain this status, however, they have less to lose” than men in the same position, based on social expectations. For decades, the number of US households with men as the primary breadwinner has steadily decreased. Experts attribute this to a number of factors, including changing gender roles in heterosexual marriages, as well as increasing numbers of women in the workforce. The decrease of male breadwinners overall is also related to a greater number of single mother households, which according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study accounts for some   of the 40% of US households with children where the primary breadwinner was a woman. According to Pew figures, 46% of   households both work   up from 31% in 1970. Figures from the US Census Bureau show that in just over 50% of all married couples, both the man and woman are in the labor force in just over 20% of couples, the man alone is in the labor force and in just under 10% only the woman is in the labor force. The new findings are based on data contained in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) a study conducted over time by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which provides data from a nationally representative group about various measures of their life, job history and general wellbeing. Survey respondents were asked how much time they spent during the last month being nervous, calm and peaceful, downhearted and blue, happy, and “so down in the dumps that nothing can cheer you up”. Their happiness level was ranked from one to five based on their response.  Philip Victor, a    journalist living in Atlanta, said he does feel pressure as the sole breadwinner in his family. He has a young child and    wife of four years who is currently studying for her nursing exam, and said both he and his wife look forward to a time when economic responsibility is shared. “But I would say that sense of pressure comes from being the primary income earner and not simply because I’m a man. “I can’t wait for the day when my wife passes her exam and starts working because we will be financially better off as a family and my wife will be thrilled about actualizing her dream of working as a nurse —   that alone will a tremendous psychological boost to both of us. ” Matt Mehrhoff, 31, a school teacher in Lincoln, Nebraska, described experience on both sides of the breadwinning equation in his marriage of four years.  He said that he and his wife have at various points taken on more or less economic burden, including when he was in graduate school, or after the recent birth of their son. “I’m not sure if it has to do with my gender, but after getting a better paying job and having a newborn, I definitely feel more pressure,” he said. “As I have been able to pay a larger share of family bills, I feel a stronger need to continue to do so or pay an even bigger share to be able to take some of the pressure off of my spouse. ” The researchers acknowledged the significant limitations of its findings, particularly as they apply to   couples. The NLSY covers people between the ages of 18 and 32 who are in heterosexual marriages. “Consequently, we cannot presume that the reported relationships will hold in older populations, gay and lesbian populations, or cohabiting populations,” the study said. The findings run counter to some previous studies about men and women in heterosexual marriages. One study by Olin Business School at Washington University in 2013 found that in relationships where women earned more than men, the latter experienced higher rates of sexual and psychological problems. The study acknowledges that the anxiety that individuals have in marriages based on their economic dependence or independence might be affected by their prior views about traditional gender roles. “It may be the case that breadwinning provokes anxiety among men who desire more equitable arrangements, but has little effect among men who desire more traditional arrangements,” the study said. “Similarly, economic dependency may elicit anxiety among women who prefer egalitarian marriages, but not among women who prefer more traditional arrangements. ”",primari breadwinn marriag like face psycholog health hurdl accord studi look potenti advers impact tradit gender role studi releas friday univers connecticut sociologist found take greater share econom respons marriag report greater strain wellb health year question famili sole breadwinn psycholog health outcom worst expect breadwinn provid famili littl help neg repercuss said lead author christin munsch professor sociolog univers connecticut know gender play marriag focus way women disadvantag said studi contribut grow bodi research demonstr way gender expect harm studi also look women found contrast psycholog outcom women take greater financi respons marriag posit effect happi wellb women approach breadwin opportun choic said munsch paper matthew roger jessica york graduat student univers breadwin women feel sens pride without worri other maintain after accomplish someth rare gender studi say women famili primari breadwinn should fail maintain statu howev less lose posit base social expect decad number household primari breadwinn steadili decreas expert attribut number factor includ chang gender role heterosexu marriag well increas number women workforc decreas male breadwinn overal also relat greater number singl mother household accord research center studi account household children primari breadwinn woman accord figur household work figur censu bureau show marri coupl woman labor forc coupl alon labor forc woman labor forc find base data contain nation longitudin survey youth nlsi studi conduct time bureau labor statist provid data nation repres group variou measur life histori gener wellb survey respond ask much time spent last month nervou calm peac downheart blue happi dump noth cheer their happi level rank five base respons philip victor journalist live atlanta said feel pressur sole breadwinn famili young child wife four year current studi nurs exam said wife look forward time econom respons share would sens pressur come primari incom earner simpli wait wife pass exam start work financi better famili wife thrill actual dream work nurs alon tremend psycholog boost matt mehrhoff school teacher lincoln nebraska describ experi side breadwin equat marriag four year said wife variou point taken less econom burden includ graduat school recent birth sure gender get better pay newborn definit feel pressur said abl larger share famili bill feel stronger need continu even bigger share abl take pressur spous research acknowledg signific limit find particularli appli coupl nlsi cover peopl age heterosexu marriag consequ cannot presum report relationship hold older popul lesbian popul cohabit popul studi said find counter previou studi women heterosexu marriag studi olin busi school washington univers found relationship women earn latter experienc higher rate sexual psycholog problem studi acknowledg anxieti individu marriag base econom depend independ might affect prior view tradit gender role case breadwin provok anxieti among desir equit arrang littl effect among desir tradit arrang studi said similarli econom depend elicit anxieti among women prefer egalitarian marriag among women prefer tradit arrang

According to Deadline, it will shoot simultaneously with the second season which will cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The first season, which was centered on the trial of OJ Simpson, was a ratings hit and won five Emmys earlier this year. The anthology series was masterminded by Ryan Murphy, who also created American Horror Story and Glee. Murphy is also working on Feud, the first season of which will focus on the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Details are scarce on the   season of American Crime Story, but it is reportedly subtitled  . Andrew Cunanan was the serial killer who murdered Versace on the steps of his Miami Beach house in 1997. Eight days later, he killed himself. It will be based on the book Vulgar Favors by Maureen Orth and Child   Spy writer Tom Rob Smith will take on the first two episodes and possible subsequent installments. No casting decisions have been made yet, but there are rumours that an   is in talks to play Donatella Versace.

34,Climate change will mean the end of national parks as we know them,"After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of America’s most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job  —   slowing the   assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation. As the National Parks Service (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent. As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the country’s history faces a daunting task. America’s grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures.  The Statue of Liberty is at “high exposure” risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, could be eaten away by rising tides in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and may be beyond rescue.  These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing America’s landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.  “Yosemite’s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,” fretted Barack Obama during a visit to the vast park in June.  “Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park.  “Rising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That’s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation. ” Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS study from 2014 found four in five of America’s national parks are now at the “extreme end” of temperature variables charted since 1901.  “We are starting to see things spiral away now,” said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. “We are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation. ” There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react. If there is a front line, it’s probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth. Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The   coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that haven’t burned in almost 5, 000 years. These trends imperil treasures such as those found in Cape Krusenstern national monument on the   coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9, 000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it. Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the   coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus  —   a type of half   knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast. “A lot of these sites haven’t been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,” Devenport said. “You can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses. “Most people haven’t thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, it’s not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal. ” The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today’s Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists.  “It’s a big problem,” Devenport acknowledged. “It’s probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50, 000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan.  “When that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. You’ve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used. ” Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the  . Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in historic structures at Tumacácori national historical park in southern Arizona. The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of   clay. The NPS already devotes 2, 500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage. “For the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the   US, losses are already rapidly occurring,” said the NPS’ Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue.  Meyer said there is a “great urgency” to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. “The longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,” she said. Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve   sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on. Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2. 4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1. 5F)  —   but the trend is inexorably upwards. This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: “Tug on anything at all and you’ll find it connected to everything else in the universe. ” Climate change is set to alter American forests as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms.  The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate.   species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name may not be able to adapt. Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves warming river waters will force out the salmon. “It’s hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,” said Schuurman.  “We need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it. ” A pressing question for the NPS is how these changes will go down with the public. Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the “existential” threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin. Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean “national parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with   facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation’s remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land. ” Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or  .  Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, according to one forecast. The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest. Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won’t involve seeing any actual glaciers. “Yes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,” said Schuurman. “Without being blasé in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss. ” Temperature rise, Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2. 4F in the past century.  Disappearing snow and ice  The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the park’s glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century. Sea level rise, Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS analysis calling it “one of the most obvious and most challenging impacts” of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Wildfire, The wildfire season in the west is far lengthier than it was in the 1970s. The risk is compounded by shrinking snow abundance  —   in Yellowstone there is an average of 30 fewer days with snow on the ground compared to the 1960s.",after centuri shoo away hunter tend trail

35,Gridlock in West Africa: Accra’s troubled attempts to tackle its traffic crisis,"Every morning before the sun rises, Stella Ampofo, a    single mother of two boys, frantically gathers her belongings and sets off for work to beat the morning traffic in Ghana’s capital, Accra. If she doesn’t leave before daybreak, congestion during rush hour could extend her   journey from Accra’s suburbs towards downtown to three or four hours.  “I’m in trouble if I leave my house around 6 or 6. 30am,” Ampofo says. “I then won’t arrive at work until nine or 10am, and that creates a lot of problems with my manager because I’m supposed to get there by eight. If the government doesn’t do anything about the traffic, it’s not going to get any easier   …    ”  To ensure a punctual arrival, Ampofo, a seamstress at a manufacturing centre that converts plastic waste into reusable products, leaves her home at 4am every day and begins work an hour later  —   just as the road traffic starts to build up, as roughly 2 million daily commuters converge on the central business district in downtown Accra. Clouds of black exhaust fumes hover over the heads of impatient motorists. Cab drivers blast their horns, while pedestrians scurry on to rickety commercialised minibuses  —   referred to as “tro tros” by locals  —   that carry up to   passengers squeezed tightly together. Only motorcyclists who can skilfully manoeuvre between lanes are able to bypass the congestion. Although gridlock typically costs European economies billions of dollars annually, insufficient data in developing countries makes it difficult to assess the economic impact on cities such as Accra. A recent report by the World Bank measuring the cost of air pollution globally, however, provides some insight into how congestion affects people’s health. Gridlock causes longer travel times, which increases fuel use and emissions. In 2013, a total of 17, 524 Ghanaians died from air pollution, a 107% increase from 1990.  “Accra has struggled with the management of the mobility challenges and rising traffic congestion on almost all arterial routes to the central business district,” Lawrence Kumi, director of research, statistics and information management at Ghana’s Ministry of Transport, admits in an email. “The implementation of various remedial measures was on an   basis and not well coordinated. There was the need for a holistic approach. ” In 2014, the government of Ghana began developing a plan to reduce congestion and overhaul the urban transportation system in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (Gama) which includes Accra and its outskirts. The plan was in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica) and supported by a $1. 5m grant from the South Korean government. Before the end of this year, the final transport master plan (TMP) is due to be presented to Ghana’s ministry of transport for implementation. The plan seeks to “bring together all modes of transport   …     not only by road” and “reduce traffic congestion and logistic costs” over the next 20 years. Greater Accra’s current population of around 4. 3 million is predicted to almost double by 2035  —   likewise the number of vehicles on the roads. While increased congestion can reflect a city’s growing economic vitality, the potential negative effects  —   low worker productivity,   delays, more dangerous roads, commuter stress, pressure on road infrastructure and an unhealthy intake of dirty fuel emissions  —   will place a serious strain on the city if it is not addressed soon. Accra is not alone in facing transportation challenges. Nearby Lagos, the economic capital of Nigeria, is notorious for being one of the most gridlocked cities in the world. But its population is around five times Accra’s, and its economy greater than the whole of Ghana  —   so according to Kweku Amoasi, associate director for transport planning at the   engineering consultancy RSK, Accra should have no excuse when it comes to severe congestion. “With a small population, Ghana should be able to manage traffic much better,” Amoasi says. “There’s just been a total lack of foresight. The planners should sit down and realise they’re not doing this for themselves they’re doing it for the nation. ”  Bernard Abeiku Arthur, a senior urban specialist with   Cities Alliance, says it is this kind of regulatory neglect that has led to today’s unabating traffic troubles and dysfunctional transport system in Accra. “We knew the population was growing,” Arthur says. “We knew we were getting urbanised, but we ignored all the necessary ingredients and elements for planning our urban space properly. ” Arthur says the new TMP is “very fanciful” on paper, but also too limiting geographically  —   excluding regions beyond Greater Accra from which much of the traffic originates. “The urban area is impacted by the fringes,” Arthur said. “So if you’re doing your calculation and you cut out the fringes, you might not be doing a very good calculation. ”  Francis Akakpo, programme officer at Koica in Ghana, says the planners were unable to conduct research on areas beyond the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area because of “limited time and resources”.  Ghana’s first mass transit bus system, Omnibus Services Authority, was established in 1927 during the British colonial period. After independence, public transportation remained largely   until the late 1980s and early 90s, when the government divested itself of assets amid financial mismanagement. This was when the privately run buses appeared to fill the gap: the tro tro, a significant contributor to congestion, has been the most common mode of mass transportation ever since.  In September, however, the Greater Accra Passenger Transport Executive launched a pilot run of a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, unleashing city buses across several major routes throughout Greater Accra. In defiance of Ghana president John Mahama’s claims that this marked “the beginning of a new modern public transport network” for the city, tro tro operators and other commercial drivers threatened to strike over fears the new buses would force them out of operation.  The final TMP proposes building on the city’s new bus network by replacing thousands of tro tros with   buses that promise to be safer, faster and more comfortable  —   a move that looks set to increase tensions with the existing transport providers. These buses will only be released “on a gradual, incremental basis, to make room for adoption and acceptance” says Koica’s Francis Akakpo. But according to Abeiku from Cities Alliance, even a successful implementation of the public bus system will only provide minimal relief to congestion. For sustainable   improvements, he says, planners must commit to focusing on rail, tram and subway developments so commuters like Stella Ampofo aren’t forced to upend their daily lives just to get to work.   “We have to envision what kind of city we want Accra to be,” Abeiku says. “Do we want a city that supports its economy, whose people feel free to move around? A city where public transportation is properly regulated? That is the kind of city I want. ” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",everi morn rise stella ampofo singl mother boy frantic gather belong set work beat morn traffic ghana capit accra leav daybreak congest rush hour could extend journey accra suburb toward downtown three four hour troubl leav hous around ampofo say arriv work nine creat problem manag suppos eight govern anyth traffic go easier ensur punctual arriv ampofo seamstress manufactur centr convert plastic wast reusabl product leav home everi begin work hour later road traffic start build roughli million daili commut converg central busi district downtown accra cloud black exhaust fume hover head impati motorist driver blast horn pedestrian scurri ricketi commercialis minibus refer tro local carri passeng squeez tightli togeth onli motorcyclist skil manoeuvr lane abl bypass congest although gridlock typic cost european economi billion dollar annual insuffici data develop countri make difficult assess econom impact citi accra recent report world bank measur cost pollut global howev provid insight congest affect peopl health gridlock caus longer travel time increas fuel emiss total ghanaian die pollut increas accra struggl manag mobil challeng rise traffic congest almost arteri rout central busi district lawrenc kumi director research statist inform manag ghana ministri transport admit email implement variou remedi measur basi well coordin there need holist approach govern ghana began develop plan reduc congest overhaul urban transport system greater accra metropolitan area gama includ accra outskirt plan collabor korea intern cooper agenc koica support grant south korean govern befor year final transport master plan present ghana ministri transport implement plan seek bring togeth mode transport road reduc traffic congest logist cost next year greater accra current popul around million predict almost doubl likewis number vehicl road while increas congest reflect citi grow econom vital potenti neg effect worker product delay danger road commut stress pressur road infrastructur unhealthi intak dirti fuel emiss place seriou strain citi address soon accra alon face transport challeng nearbi lago econom capit nigeria notori gridlock citi world popul around five time accra economi greater whole ghana accord kweku amoasi associ director transport plan engin consult accra excus come sever congest with small popul ghana abl manag traffic much better amoasi say there total lack foresight planner realis nation bernard abeiku arthur senior urban specialist citi allianc say kind regulatori neglect today unab traffic troubl dysfunct transport system accra knew popul grow arthur say knew get urbanis ignor necessari ingredi element plan urban space properli arthur say fanci paper also limit geograph exclud region beyond greater accra much traffic origin urban area impact fring arthur said calcul fring might good calcul franci akakpo programm offic koica ghana say planner unabl conduct research area beyond greater accra metropolitan area limit time resourc ghana first mass transit system omnibu servic author establish british coloni period after independ public transport remain larg late earli govern divest asset amid financi mismanag thi privat buse appear fill signific contributor congest common mode mass transport ever sinc septemb howev greater accra passeng transport execut launch pilot rapid transport system unleash citi buse across sever major rout throughout greater accra defianc ghana presid john mahama claim mark begin modern public transport network citi oper commerci driver threaten strike fear buse would forc oper final propos build citi network replac thousand tro buse promis safer faster comfort move look increas tension exist transport provid these buse releas gradual increment basi make room adopt accept say koica franci akakpo accord abeiku citi allianc even success implement public system provid minim relief congest sustain improv say planner must commit focus rail tram subway develop commut like stella ampofo forc upend daili live work envis kind citi want accra abeiku say want citi support economi whose peopl feel free move around citi public transport properli regul that kind citi want follow guardian citi twitter facebook join discuss
36,Michelle Obama: ‘She took first lady chic and made it modern’,"When Michelle Obama gets on the microphone, the world listens. Her speech at the Democratic convention in July was judged by many to be the best of the week, reaching the emotional and inspirational heights that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has sometimes struggled to achieve. Her turn on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden this summer, singing Beyoncé and Stevie Wonder, has, at the time of writing, been watched nearly 44m times on YouTube. But for most of the eight years she has lived in the White House, there has been no microphone. Obama is seen a good deal more than she is heard, so how she looks has taken on disproportionate significance. Her image sets the emotional tone for the White House, becoming a symbolic ideal for other women, for other wives and mothers. Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood every dress evaluated for the values it embodies. There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obama’s intellect and background. There is a    rhythm to this kind of coverage, with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a   lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. Yet, contrary to what many expected, Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key. In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clinton’s battles over public healthcare, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes: family nutrition, childhood health and girls’ education, issues that sit neatly around her   identity as   . While these causes are, perhaps, more culturally loaded than they first appear  —   the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant when you take into account the fact that the issue disproportionately affects   and black families  —   they have frustrated those who hoped for a more radical rewrite. Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona. On the night of her husband’s election to office in 2008, she wore a Narciso Rodriguez dress in a fiery    speckle pattern. The fashion press reported the pattern as “dégradé” while others went with “lava lamp”. To wear a very   dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style. She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture, which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe. Until Obama, the iconography of the first lady revolved around Jackie Kennedy. There had been glamorous president’s wives since  —   Nancy Reagan with her Dynasty gowns, say  —   but the notion of first lady chic remained almost synonymous with that sunny yet streamlined   style that is for ever Camelot. Half a century later, wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy, but the comparison is sharpest in the White House. Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style, as if anxious to avoid the comparison, Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own. The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link, as are the outsize strings of pearls, often framed by   necklines. Even elements of the two women’s hair and makeup are similar, despite their physical difference: note the full, stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes. The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic, and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message. The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference: their skin colour. It’s a way of emphasising the historic nature of the Obamas as the first black family to live in the White House, while at the same time telling the world that this family, and this administration, is traditionally American. At the first inauguration, in January 2009, Obama wore a dress and matching coat in an unusual shade of pale greenish yellow that observers struggled to put a name to. (The Guardian went with lemongrass.) Her elder daughter, Malia, wore a purple coat with black scarf and gloves her younger daughter, Sasha, a pink coat with orange scarf and gloves. The colours made for a dazzlingly confident family portrait. Other elements of the look were formal, even traditional (the first lady’s sleek leather gloves, the two girls in their cosy,   coats) but the colours were modern, the cheery brights of a holiday snap rather than the sepia tones of an official photograph. That was the day Obama took first lady chic and made it modern and   . Later that year, on a state visit to Britain, she wore an Azzedine Alaïa cardigan to meet the Queen. “You don’t go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater,” sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta  —   but he was already out of touch. Obama’s approachable,   wardrobe had struck a chord. Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly   Obama has rewritten the playbook. In early 2009, when the first lady’s official website was launched featuring a photo of her wearing a sleeveless dress, the Chicago Tribune reported that it had received hundreds of online responses, many of which criticised the look for its inappropriate informality. Since then, the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun, dressy but comfortable  —   fuelled, in huge part, by Obama herself  —   has grown and grown. She made it OK for a   woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious   as well as those signature warm Mobama hugs. In that sense, she represents a generation growing old in a different way. Many of her fashion choices  —   from the girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown she wore for the first inauguration to the full skirts she often favours for daytime  —   are looks that not long ago would have been thought too young, too cute, for a woman in her 50s to carry off. Instead, she has captured something of the confidence of a generation who will not accept that they should slip into the shadows. Obama has consistently played down any interest in fashion. “It’s so hard. I’m kind of a   at heart, but I like to look nice,” she told ABC news in 2008. But she has steered her image carefully nonetheless. When she appeared on the cover of American Vogue in March 2009, she did it on condition that the choice of dress was hers, without input from the Vogue team, and that she used her own hair and makeup stylists, something the magazine had not agreed to before. Even the designer and   Tom Ford, renowned for his control freak tendencies, alluded to Obama’s strictures in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, when he related the experience of dressing the first lady for an audience with the Queen in 2011. “Doing something like that is easy because you’re dictated to,” he said. “‘She needs to wear that colour, she has to have gloves, she doesn’t like this, she doesn’t like that.’ It’s pretty simple. ” Simple, but strategic. Obama’s mastery of fashion is less about the clothes than about a modern woman’s innate understanding that visual messaging is a crucial part of public life. As she told American InStyle magazine last month, “We can fool ourselves into thinking that everybody is still watching the evening news, but I live with Generation Z, and I know that their habits, the way they take in information, are so different  …     We’ve got to meet our constituents where they are, and they’re on Snapchat. ” Obama has been on Snapchat since June. Her opening post? A selfie and the emoji of the girl in pink, her hand raised. This is a woman who doesn’t need a microphone to get her words across.",when michel obama get microphon world listen speech democrat convent juli judg mani best week reach emot inspir height hillari clinton presidenti campaign sometim struggl achiev turn carpool karaok jame corden summer sing beyonc stevi wonder time write watch nearli time youtub eight year live white hous microphon obama seen good deal heard look taken disproportion signific imag set emot tone white hous becom symbol ideal women wive mother everi hairstyl comb cipher chang nation mood everi dress evalu valu embodi there deni feel retrograd woman obama intellect background there rhythm kind coverag everi fashion featur wardrob trigger opinion piec rage unbefit treatment lawyer degre harvard princeton contrari mani expect obama play role notabl tradit contrast predecessor hillari clinton battl public healthcar adopt rel uncontroversi caus famili nutrit childhood health girl educ issu neatli around ident while caus perhap cultur load first appear campaign childhood obes progress slant take account fact issu disproportion affect black famili frustrat hope radic rewrit obama follow first ladi tradit put fashion centr stage public persona night husband elect offic wore narciso rodriguez dress fieri speckl pattern fashion press report pattern grad other went lava lamp wear dress moment made clear obama intent allow white hous cramp style broken unspoken rule modern cultur hold seriou person must sober wardrob until obama iconographi first ladi revolv around jacki kennedi there glamor presid wive sinc nanci reagan dynasti gown notion first ladi chic remain almost synonym sunni streamlin style ever camelot half centuri later wive head state world still measur kennedi comparison sharpest white hous where predecessor tipto around edg kennedi style anxiou avoid comparison obama embrac mani element look made sleeveless shift dress favour direct link outsiz string pearl often frame necklin even element women hair makeup similar despit physic differ note full stiffli curl hair penchant fals eyelash kennedi repres american ideal classi democrat obama use fashion alli husband messag visual connect kennedi draw obviou differ skin colour emphasis histor natur obama first black famili live white hous time tell world famili administr tradit american first inaugur januari obama wore dress match coat unusu shade pale greenish yellow observ struggl name guardian went lemongrass elder daughter malia wore purpl coat black scarf glove younger daughter sasha pink coat orang scarf glove colour made dazzlingli confid famili portrait other element look formal even tradit first ladi sleek leather glove girl cosi coat colour modern cheeri bright holiday snap rather sepia tone offici photograph that obama took first ladi chic made modern later year state visit britain wore azzedin cardigan meet queen buckingham palac sweater snif design oscar renta alreadi touch obama approach wardrob struck chord without wear singl outfit could consid truli obama rewritten playbook earli first ladi offici websit launch featur photo wear sleeveless dress chicago tribun report receiv hundr onlin respons mani criticis look inappropri inform sinc trend sleeveless dress grownup dressi comfort fuell huge part obama grown grown made woman wear dress showcas arm speak seriou well signatur warm mobama hug sens repres gener grow differ mani fashion choic girlish bridal jason gown wore first inaugur full skirt often favour daytim look long would thought young cute woman carri instead captur someth confid gener accept slip shadow obama consist play interest fashion hard kind heart like look nice told news steer imag care nonetheless when appear cover american vogu march condit choic dress without input vogu team use hair makeup stylist someth magazin agre even design ford renown control freak tendenc allud obama strictur recent interview hollywood report relat experi dress first ladi audienc queen do someth like easi dictat said need wear colour glove like like pretti simpl simpl strateg obama masteri fashion less cloth modern woman innat understand visual messag crucial part public life told american instyl magazin last month fool think everybodi still watch even news live gener know habit take inform differ meet constitu snapchat obama snapchat sinc june open post selfi emoji girl pink hand rais thi woman need microphon word across
37,USA make do with silver in men’s team archery as South Koreans clinch gold,"South Korea’s archers routed the United States to win the men’s team gold at the Rio Olympics on Saturday and restore a dynasty broken by the Americans at London four years ago. The peerless trio of Kim   Ku   and Lee   roared to a   win on a baking hot day at the Sambodromo, clinching South Korea’s fifth team title and fourth in the last five Olympics. “I’ve been waiting for this moment, to get gold, for four years,” beaming world champion Kim, who fired a   world record during Friday’s ranking round, told reporters. “We trusted each other, and it happened. It just happened. ” The US team, who ended the South Koreans’ run of three titles in the London   were left with a second successive silver after the Koreans closed out the match in style with a run of perfect scores. Australia celebrated their first archery medal in 12 years by defeating China for the bronze. All three Olympic debutants, Kim, Ku and Lee, showed no sign of rookie nerves as they trampled over Netherlands and Australia before saving their best for the gold  . Cheered by a rowdy Korean contingent in the terraces, the trio threw down the gauntlet in the opening set, hitting the innermost gold circle six times in succession to score the maximum 60 points. More than a statement, the opening salvo was a winding blow for the more seasoned US team of   Olympian Brady Ellison, Jake Kaminski and Zach Garrett. They shot well in response but could manage only 57 points for the set and from there the pattern of the match was fixed. The Korean onslaught was relentless. The    Ku took the perfect score of 10 points with all six of his arrows, and missed only once. Standing on the podium in the middle of a team of world champions, Ku kissed his medal and beamed, while Lee wiped a tear from his cheek during their national anthem. The team sealed South Korea’s 20th archery gold medal from 37 Olympic titles contested since the sport returned in its modern format in 1972. With its professional teams and punishing training regimes, the depth of Korean archery is unmatched and the nation will be disappointed if it fails to sweep all four titles at Rio. “There really wasn’t anything we could have controlled,” Kaminski, who lost the London final against Italy with Ellison, said resignedly. “I definitely feel we left it all out there. ”",south korea archer rout unit state team gold olymp saturday restor dynasti broken american london four year peerless trio roar bake sambodromo clinch south korea fifth team titl fourth last five olymp wait moment gold four year beam world champion fire world record friday rank round told report trust happen happen team end south korean three titl london left second success silver korean close match style perfect score australia celebr first archeri medal year defeat china bronz three olymp debut show sign rooki nerv trampl netherland australia save best gold cheer rowdi korean conting terrac trio threw gauntlet open hit innermost gold circl time success score maximum point more statement open salvo wind blow season team olympian bradi ellison jake kaminski zach garrett they shot well respons could manag point pattern match fix korean onslaught relentless took perfect score point arrow miss stand podium middl team world champion kiss medal beam wipe tear cheek nation anthem team seal south korea archeri gold medal olymp titl contest sinc sport return modern format with profession team punish train regim depth korean archeri unmatch nation disappoint fail sweep four titl there realli anyth could control kaminski lost london final itali ellison said resignedli definit feel left
38,Clinton v Trump: why the first post-debate poll should be read with caution,"Maybe you watched the first presidential debate of 2016. Maybe you’re an American voter. And maybe, just maybe, you felt one candidate was a very clear winner by the end of it all. The only question you should now be asking yourself is “how many other people in the country agreed with me?” I have one poll (and a whole bunch of caveats) for you. The poll suggests that the debate was a huge success for Hillary Clinton. The caveats suggest Democrats don’t have a reason to celebrate yet. The poll was jointly conducted by media channel CNN and research company ORC late last night. The interviewers called up people they had already identified who said they planned on watching the debate. The survey started out with this question: “Regardless of which candidate you happen to support, who do you think did the best job in the debate  —   Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?” At 62% it was a clear win for Clinton, while just 27% said Trump (6% said “both equally” and 4% said “neither” candidate won the debate). The other polling questions seemed to confirm a clear victory: Who seemed to be the stronger leader? Clinton 56% Trump 39% Who was more sincere and authentic? (Note: this has been a problem for Clinton in the past. )Clinton 53% Trump 40%  Overall, did the debate make you more likely to vote for a candidate? Clinton 34% Trump 18% It all sounds like bad news for Republicans right? Maybe not. The poll was conducted among 521 people  —   even though those people were all registered voters, that’s still not very many views you’re collecting. There’s another thing too  —   the entire poll was skewed towards Clinton to start off with. Of the people   spoke to, 41% identified themselves as Democrats and 26% identified as Republican (the rest said they were Independents). So you would have expected Clinton to do better, regardless of how she performed during the debate. If you’re feeling particularly skeptical, you should pay attention to “the margin of error” on a poll. On this one, it was +   4. 5 percentage points which means that Clinton’s lead could be much larger (take that last question above  —   the true national number could be as high as 38. 5% choosing Clinton) or it could be much smaller (maybe only 29. 5% did). When you take into account the fact that there were a lot of Democrats in this survey, that lead suddenly looks a lot less impressive.  One last thing  —   and you’ll hear me say this a lot  —   it’s only one poll. Anyone who tells you it’s a done deal after last night is probably influenced by confirmation bias which when you interpret new information (eg this poll) in a way that confirms your existing beliefs (eg “I think Clinton did pretty well”).  What actually does offer some promise of predicting voter behavior is taking a big bunch of surveys, each reputable, each with a slightly different methodology, and averaging them out. So, to really understand who won the debate, we’ll need to wait a little while because most surveys take about a week to be conducted, analyzed and then published.  Right now, in polling averages, Clinton currently has 46. 7% of support, barely ahead of Trump who receives 44. 3%. Viewers not only need to think Clinton did really well in last night’s debate, but they need to be willing to change their voting intention if the former secretary of state wants to win in November.

39,Congress remains deadlocked over $1.1bn Zika bill after seven-week break,"As the US Congress returned to Washington on Tuesday after a   recess, lawmakers remained at an impasse over funding to combat the Zika virus even after the   disease spread rapidly during the summer across Puerto Rico and a host of states across the US. Democrats in the US Senate again blocked a measure that would provide $1. 1bn in funding to tackle Zika, objecting to language inserted by House Republicans that would target Planned Parenthood, undermine healthcare and reverse a ban on flying the Confederate flag at veterans’ cemeteries. The   procedural vote marked the third time the bill had failed to garner the 60 votes required to advance, prompting a bipartisan blame game that has become par for the course on Capitol Hill. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said it was “hard to explain” why Democrats had blocked the funding, while his Democratic counterpart Harry Reid accused Republicans of being “more interested in attacking Planned Parenthood and flying the Confederate flag  —   can’t make this stuff up, that’s really the truth  —   than protecting women and babies from this awful virus”. But away from the   senators frustrated by the inaction conceded an agreement must be reached with just three weeks remaining until lawmakers depart once more for a final stretch at home before election day.  Roy Blunt, a senator from Missouri and member of Republican leadership, signaled the path forward could be to tie Zika funding to a continuing resolution that must be passed by 30 September to prevent a shutdown of the federal government. Although he did not yet know what that package might look like, Blunt acknowledged that Republicans might have to do without the Planned Parenthood rider and other provisions being decried by Democrats as “poison pills”.  “Surely, the goal of the Senate should be to get each of those things done as soon as we possibly could,” he said. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters it was “pretty clear” Democrats were not going to accept the language related to Planned Parenthood and renewed his call for House Republicans to take up a bipartisan Zika bill that passed the Senate back in May. That measure provided $1. 1bn in funding with no strings attached. Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine known for forging compromises across party lines, was more explicit in calling for the language restricting funds to a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico to be dropped from the bill. “Given that a lot of women are going to decide to delay childbearing during this public health crisis, it does not make sense to exclude an organization like Planned Parenthood which is a source of family planning for so many,” she said. “I view this as a public health crisis and one that we should act on. ” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated more than 2, 700 cases of Zika in the continental US  —   putting the figures at more than double what they were when Congress skipped town in July without resolving the stalemate. There are at least 14, 000 cases in US territories, with Puerto Rico the most heavily impacted by the virus. Barack Obama, who first called for $1. 8bn in funding to combat Zika in February, was forced to reallocate money from other programs  —   such cancer research  —   which public health officials said were no less vital. It was the only way to prevent a lapse in clinical trials for vaccine development, which CDC director Tom Frieden warned could soon grind to a halt without additional funds from Congress. The pleas of health experts have nonetheless gone ignored against the backdrop of   politics.  Speaking at a rally in Tampa, Florida, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reiterated her call on Republicans to vote in favor of a Zika bill that did not seek concessions in return. “They can’t help themselves from playing games, even when lives are on the line,” Clinton said. “I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote on a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida. ” South Florida, dubbed as “ground zero” for Zika in the US, remains the hardest hit by the outbreak. In addition to the state having confirmed 577 cases of people who contracted the virus while traveling overseas, concerns are now rising over local transmissions.  The Florida department of health announced seven new cases on Tuesday in which people contracted Zika from mosquitos in Miami Beach  —   the epicenter of the city’s $24bn tourism industry  —   bringing the tally of homegrown cases above 50. With control of the Senate up for grabs in November, the partisan rancor over Zika could prove a wedge issue in the battleground of Florida. Rubio, who is seeking   to a second term, is facing a challenge from Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy in a race that is critical for Republicans to hold onto their slim   majority. Murphy on Tuesday attacked Rubio as ineffective in delivering Zika funding to Florida, telling reporters his opponent was “playing politics with women’s health. ” His comments followed a new   ad buy in Florida by Naral   America, one of the nation’s largest abortion rights groups, which targets Rubio for opposing abortion even if a woman is infected by Zika.  But not everyone is as willing to trade barbs over a public health crisis. Bill Nelson, the senior senator from Florida and a Democrat, defended Rubio’s efforts to secure funding for Zika, and pointed out that Rubio was the only Senate Republican who supported meeting Obama’s request in full. “Remember, he voted for the $1. 9bn, he was my   and he voted for the $1. 1bn with no riders,” Nelson said, while noting that voters would ultimately “see through the political machinations” on both sides. “The person that hasn’t delivered a Zika funding bill is Mitch McConnell,” he added.  Speaking on the Senate floor following the Zika vote, Rubio warned that Congress had arrived at a “moment of truth”. “How will history remember this moment 20 years from now if  —   God forbid  —   there are hundreds or even thousands of children who were born with microcephaly while we stood here, playing politics, and did nothing?” he said. “This has the potential to tarnish the legacy of our generation of national leaders  —   and, far worse, to cause grave health challenges for an untold number of Americans. ”",congress return washington tuesday recess lawmak remain impass fund combat zika viru even diseas spread rapidli summer across puerto rico host state across democrat senat block measur would provid fund tackl zika object languag insert hous republican would target plan parenthood undermin healthcar revers fli confeder flag veteran cemeteri procedur vote mark third time bill fail garner vote requir advanc prompt bipartisan blame game becom cours capitol hill senat major leader mitch mcconnel said hard explain democrat block fund democrat counterpart harri reid accus republican interest attack plan parenthood fli confeder flag make stuff realli truth protect women babi aw viru away senat frustrat inact conced agreement must reach three week remain lawmak depart final stretch home elect blunt senat missouri member republican leadership signal path forward could zika fund continu resolut must pass septemb prevent shutdown feder govern although know packag might look like blunt acknowledg republican might without plan parenthood rider provis decri democrat poison pill sure goal senat thing done soon possibl could said marco rubio florida senat former republican presidenti candid told report pretti clear democrat go accept languag relat plan parenthood renew call hous republican take bipartisan zika bill pass senat back that measur provid fund string attach susan collin republican senat main known forg compromis across parti line explicit call languag restrict fund plan parenthood affili puerto rico drop bill given women go decid delay childbear public health crisi make sens exclud organ like plan parenthood sourc famili plan mani said view public health crisi center diseas control prevent estim case zika continent put figur doubl congress skip town juli without resolv stalem there least case territori puerto rico heavili impact viru barack obama first call fund combat zika februari forc realloc money program cancer research public health offici said less vital prevent laps clinic trial vaccin develop director frieden warn could soon grind halt without addit fund congress plea health expert nonetheless gone ignor backdrop polit speak ralli tampa florida democrat presidenti nomine hillari clinton reiter call republican vote favor zika bill seek concess return they help play game even live line clinton said call republican peopl polit final vote clean fund bill fight zika right florida south florida dub ground zero zika remain hardest outbreak addit state confirm case peopl contract viru travel oversea concern rise local transmiss florida depart health announc seven case tuesday peopl contract zika mosquito miami beach epicent citi tourism industri bring talli homegrown case with control senat grab novemb partisan rancor zika could prove wedg issu battleground florida rubio seek second term face challeng democrat congressman patrick murphi race critic republican hold onto slim major murphi tuesday attack rubio ineffect deliv zika fund florida tell report oppon play polit women health comment follow florida naral america nation largest abort right group target rubio oppos abort even woman infect zika everyon will trade barb public health crisi bill nelson senior senat florida democrat defend rubio effort secur fund zika point rubio senat republican support meet obama request full rememb vote vote rider nelson said note voter would ultim polit machin side person deliv zika fund bill mitch mcconnel ad speak senat floor follow zika vote rubio warn congress arriv moment truth histori rememb moment year forbid hundr even thousand children born microcephali stood play polit noth said thi potenti tarnish legaci gener nation leader wors caus grave health challeng untold number american
40,"Possible Romney appointment provokes ’deluge’ of opposition, says Trump aide","Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway has highlighted the opposition to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney becoming secretary of state. Romney has emerged as one of the frontrunners for the position, despite criticisms he had made about Trump in the past. In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Conway drew attention to what she described as a “deluge of social media  private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state”. Conway appeared to be referring to comments by former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former House speaker Newt Gingrich that questioned how loyal Romney, who was the Republican nominee for president in 2012, could be to Trump. In a second tweet she added that previous secretaries of state such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz “flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist. ”  Trump’s decision over the state department is widely considered to be a heated battle between Romney supporters and those, like Huckabee and Gingrich, who favor the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.  A third group is said to be pressing for the search for an alternative to continue.  In comments on Wednesday, Huckabee warned that appointments of disloyal Republicans could prove to be a distraction to Trump.  “It’s not about that I don’t care for Mitt personally, but I’m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump,” Huckabee told Fox News. “He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor. ” At the Republican convention in July, Romney attempted to induce voters to cast their primary ballot for whichever Republican could beat Trump. In March, he called Trump a “phony” and dissed Trump’s business acumen. “A business genius he is not,” Romney said, adding that Trump’s “promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University”. Trump countered that Romney was a failed candidate who would have “dropped to his knees” for his endorsement.  Gingrich, meanwhile, offered that the only way Romney could be considered for an administration post would be if he publicly repudiated every criticism he had made of Trump. The former House speaker said Romney was the “most vicious and most explicit opponent all through the campaign on the Republican side”. “I think as the new president, to build the team he wants to build, but I would suggest there are a lot of other people who are more qualified than Romney in foreign policy and who also have not been as actively hostile as he’s been. ” After Trump met with Romney last weekend, Trump’s transition team described the meeting as an “extremely positive and productive conversation”.",trump spokeswoman kellyann conway highlight opposit former massachusett governor mitt romney becom secretari state romney emerg frontrunn posit despit critic made trump past tweet earlier thursday conway drew attent describ delug social media privat comm romney some trump loyalist warn romney state conway appear refer comment former arkansa governor mike huckabe former hous speaker newt gingrich question loyal romney republican nomine presid could trump second tweet ad previou secretari state henri kissing georg shultz flew around world less counsel potu close home loyal good checklist trump decis state depart wide consid heat battl romney support like huckabe gingrich favor former york mayor rudi giuliani third group said press search altern continu comment wednesday huckabe warn appoint disloy republican could prove distract trump care mitt person still unhappi mitt everyth could derail donald trump huckabe told new attack person level charact integr honor republican convent juli romney attempt induc voter cast primari ballot whichev republican could beat trump march call trump phoni diss trump busi acumen busi geniu romney said ad trump promis worthless degre trump univers trump counter romney fail candid would drop knee endors gingrich meanwhil offer romney could consid administr post would publicli repudi everi critic made trump former hous speaker said romney viciou explicit oppon campaign republican side think presid build team want build would suggest peopl qualifi romney foreign polici also activ hostil after trump romney last weekend trump transit team describ meet extrem posit product convers
41,’I’m no threat’ – will Obama pardon one of the world’s longest-serving political prisoners?,"Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their epic migration from Canada to Mexico. It is one of the wonders of the world: insects whose distinctive orange and black wings barely stretch four inches flying on thermal currents up to 3, 000 miles in search of a warm spot to spend the winter. The phenomenon has entranced Oscar López Rivera since his childhood days in rural Puerto Rico. If he ever gets the chance, he says, one of his great ambitions is to trace the monarchs’ route, all the way from the Canadian border, across the US great plains into northern Mexico. “The monarch is fascinating to me,” he says. “The length of their journey and what they do to survive: how can an insect so small go so far?” That’s an achingly powerful question when you consider who is posing it. For the past 35 years, López Rivera has been unable to fly, his wings clipped. He has been held in federal institutions, for 12 of those years totally alone inside a    concrete box from which he had no view of the sky. The last time he saw a live butterfly, let alone a monarch, was in 1981. López Rivera is one of the US’s, and the world’s,   political prisoners. Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars. He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one. His crime was “seditious conspiracy”  —   plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence. He still believes in what he calls that “noble cause”: full sovereignty for his Caribbean birthplace that is classified as a US “territory”. But his views on how to attain that goal have changed. Two decades ago he and his fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform. The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983. Yet there he still sits in his prison cell, reading and painting, the last of his kind locked up, so venerable that other prisoners call him “El Viejo”  —   the Old One. It is as though he is stuck in a   trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a   septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic. The world, and López Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age.  Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday. Fortunately for López Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama. As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope. Many prominent supporters are lobbying hard for the pardon. They make for an impressive list: Archbishop Desmond Tutu the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress former US president Jimmy Carter Democratic presidential   Bernie Sanders and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton,   Miranda, who confronted Obama about López Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit. On 9 October thousands of supporters gathered outside the White House bearing placards of the prisoner and calling on Obama to set him free, their voices projected across the mansion’s South Lawn in the hope that the president at work in the Oval Office might hear them and act accordingly. With friends like that, isn’t López Rivera a   for release? Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances. “I do not practise wishful thinking,” he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent. “It’s very difficult for me to read President Obama. The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions. ” What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom. In the course of a   phone conversation (the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice: the professorial tone is true to the man. López Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama’s frequent expressions of admiration for Nelson Mandela. “He embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world. ” To invite comparison with Mandela may seem   for a man who in the US is relatively little known, but back home López Rivera is often cast as the “Mandela of Puerto Rico”. Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an   liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool López Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing. Mandela refused to renounce violence from his prison cell but López Rivera did so, some 20 years ago. López Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebastián in the   of Puerto Rico. His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between. Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as López Rivera would soon discover. Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata. Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the   principle of no taxation without representation. “The only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder,” López Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin.  Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebastián and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14. He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of   or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics. “Before I got drafted I was a    Puerto Rican. I enjoyed life. I wasn’t paying attention to anything other than me. ” Then along came Vietnam. “I arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn’t happening. We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies,   them. ” By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation. “I felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective. Now I could see what colonialism did to people. ” He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago. That brought him into contact with the families of imprisoned nationalists and, without ever suspecting that he would one day join their ranks, he was sucked into the movement and eventually became a member of the clandestine Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional. As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end. Between its foundation in 1974 and its effective demise in 1983 as a result of mass arrests, the FALN was said by prosecutors to have carried out about 140 bombings on military bases, government offices and financial buildings across the US, especially in Chicago and New York. Targets were chosen for being symbols of “Yankee imperialism” such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters. López Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people. “For me human life is sacred. We called it ‘armed propaganda’  —   using targets to draw attention to our struggle. ” That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent. In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington’s farewell to troops after the American revolution. The attack killed four people and injured more than 50. Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device. López Rivera has denied involvement with these fatal attacks. But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: “I cannot comment on that. ” Interestingly, he still claims justification for violence under international law, using the present tense: “I believe we were adhering to international law that says that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that colonial people have a right to achieve   by any means, including force. ” But he is also adamant that the decision to renounce force was real and permanent. By 1990, the movement was already changing with the times. “We realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning. Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do. You cannot get a better world by being unjust yourself. ” When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies: “I don’t think I could be a threat. We have transcended violence  —   it’s crucial for people to understand, we’re not advocating anything that would be a threat to anyone. ” He was picked up in 1981 at a traffic stop in Chicago and charged with seditious conspiracy  —   a very rare count of plotting against the US state that was first used after the civil war against southern refuseniks and then applied to anarchists and socialists before being turned against Puerto Rican independistas like himself.  At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks. For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial. He still describes seditious conspiracy as an “impossible crime”. He told me: “How can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?” He was sentenced to 55 years. By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10. 3 years. Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it. In a less disciplined individual, such harsh treatment would inevitably spawn bitterness and despair. Not for López Rivera. He recounts his time in prison with verve bordering on enthusiasm. Yes, he has faced “terrible times” been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a “spic” and worse. But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says. “When I first got to prison I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time. I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals. From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active. ” That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching,   and   sidewinders and upper body routines. He reads a lot. Currently, he’s reading Edward Said’s Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer’s book on billionaire rightwing donors, Dark Money. He teaches other inmates to read and write or speak Spanish. He also likes to paint as a way of “taking myself out of prison into the outside world”. He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world. He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado. He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky. “Little by little, colours start to fade. Your eyes begin to change how you see things. You see less colour everything blurs into the   of the cell walls. ” So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life. That’s when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration. “I had to be strong. I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen. ” Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation. At its peak, he was one of two dozen independistas in federal prisons now he is the last one. Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left. He is sanguine about that. “I have never felt abandoned or lonely. There is no regret inside my heart. ” To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009. In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what López Rivera’s supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters. López Rivera was offered a lesser deal that would have seen him released after a decade, but he turned it down, because he says he had no faith in the US government sticking to its side of the bargain and he was unhappy about a couple of his fellow fighters being offered no commutation at all. “When I was in Vietnam I never left anyone behind. That’s not my practice, I couldn’t do it,” he says. Surely he must have had moments in the past seven years when he has questioned his rejection of the deal that would have set him free? “None whatsoever. I believe in principles. For me, the decision was the one I had to make. ” So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton’s footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors? One factor in Obama’s calculation might be that Clinton’s round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media. The “Clinton terror pardons” remain a bugbear for the right to this day, even though the vitriol overlooks one awkward fact about the releases: that not a single criminal act has been committed by any of the 11 former FALN militants in the 16 years that they have been out. The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama’s apparent ambivalence on the matter. He is reported to have told   Miranda that López Rivera’s clemency petition was “on his desk”. But Congress member Luis Gutiérrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has been a leading proponent of a pardon, has said that when he asked Obama about the account the president firmly disputed it and gave a bland statement that “procedures must be followed”. That sounds less than promising for the Mandela of Puerto Rico. But López Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure. “I have no choice but to be optimistic,” he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation. “Hope, that is one thing we can never lose. ”",monarch butterfli begin epic migrat canada mexico wonder world insect whose distinct orang black wing bare stretch four inch fli thermal

42,Kanye West’s travails help hip-hop open up on mental health,"In the final shot of Kanye West’s video for his 2008 track Love Lockdown the rapper curls up into a foetal position in the middle of a bright white room, his head clutched desperately in his hands. It is a moment of vulnerability many might see as being at odds with the antagonistic,   megastar, who declares himself a god, has snatched awards from the hands of Taylor Swift and makes dramatic outbursts on television chat shows. Yet this week, as news broke of the singer’s hospitalisation in the psychiatric ward of UCLA, reportedly for stress and exhaustion following a week of erratic behaviour on stage and the subsequent cancellation of his tour, the pressures on   artists to conceal mental health vulnerabilities have come under almost unprecedented scrutiny. West’s hospitalisation comes at a pivotal time for  ’s complex relationship with mental health. Rather than distancing themselves from West’s possible mental health issues, fellow musicians such as Chance the Rapper, West’s recent collaborator, told the BBC he wanted to “extend a special prayer to my big brother Kanye West”.     producer 9th Wonder tweeted:  These responses suggest attitudes, and stigmas, are changing. The macho and often adversarial culture of   coupled with the fact that African American men are significantly less likely to seek help for mental health issues, has meant, in the public arena at least, it was rarely discussed. That is not to say it has been ignored entirely. Dr Akeem Sule, a consultant psychiatrist, and Dr Becky Inkster, a clinical neuroscientist, both at the University of Cambridge, recently set up an initiative, Hip Hop Psych, after their academic research proved how much   lyrics can help people open up about their own mental health issues. “We have to look to the origins of   to really understand how much mental health has always been at its core,” said Sule and Inkster. “It developed in the mid 70s in the South Bronx, where gangs were roaming the streets, there was a drug epidemic, there was extreme poverty, a housing crisis. You throw in absent fathers, losing family to crime, people with no support all those are ingredients for mental health problems. ” The pair pointed to songs such as Tupac Shakur’s So Many Tears, where he speaks about the impact his environment has on his own mental health and the struggles he has coping, as well as Geto Boys’   track Mind Playing Tricks on Me, which is widely acknowledged to be about psychosis. However, the disparity, Sule and Inkster pointed out, was that while the lyrics documented struggle and depression, it was a very different story when it came to artists giving interviews or performing. “There was this very masculine culture of   where you had to be resilient and you couldn’t show any signs of weakness,” said Sule and Inkster. “While the lyrics spoke of mental health problems covertly, there was a stigma, particularly with the black men living in these communities where rap and   was emerging from, about saying outright ‘I have depression’ or addressing mental health issues. ” But, as the conversation around mental health in the music industry has opened up over the past couple of years, particularly over the psychological toll of being in the public eye,   had “evolved and started owning depression as something other than a sign of weakness,” said Sule and Inkster. In October, Ohio rapper Kid Cudi, made a public statement to say he had been hospitalised and admitted “anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember”. “Its been difficult for me to find the words to what I’m about to share with you because I feel ashamed,” he wrote. “Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges   …     I’m scared, I’m sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, I’m sorry. It’s time I fix me. I’m nervous but   …     [I’m going to] get through this. ” The wave of support that Kid Cudi received from some of the biggest names in   from A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott to Wiz Khalifa and even West himself  —   and the fact it gave rise to trending hashtag #YouGoodMan as a way to discuss race, masculinity and depression  —   was a clear indicator that the mental health stigma in   is dissipating. According to Inkster and Sule it was a conversation that began to open up in 2011 when DMX admitted that many of his public struggles with addiction and crime were related to his bipolar disorder. More recently, it has been evident in rapper J Cole talking publicly about his struggle with depression, and fronting the #OKNotToBeOK campaign and in   Chicago rapper Vic Mensa’s recent comments about his own suppressed mental health issues. “Mental health is something that a lot of people just aren’t ready to talk about, especially in the black community, especially black men. It’s very taboo, it’s very outside of the norm for black men to think it’s OK to see a therapist or anything like that,” said Mensa recently. Charles Hamilton, a rapper who emerged to great acclaim in 2009, going on to collaborate with Eminem among others, very publicly unravelled and was later sectioned due to bipolar disorder. Returning to the public eye last year, he too spoke openly about his mental health issues. “I just didn’t trust anybody. I didn’t leave my house, I just made music all the time. I was fighting depression, I shut myself in,” he admitted. “I wanted to commit career suicide, physical suicide, spiritual suicide, I didn’t care anymore. ” Yet for Inkster and Sule, the most significant figure breaking down this stigma around depression and revealing weakness is Kendrick Lamar. Arguably the world’s biggest   artist, they said Lamar’s public discussion of the inner demons and survivors’ guilt that fuelled his   album, To Pimp a Butterfly, have proved that depression is no longer perceived as a fallacy in the rap community. “Back in the early days of   that would never happen,” they said. “Yes, there are still braggadocio lyrics and attitudes but I would say   has made great strides. ”",final shot kany west video track love lockdown rapper curl foetal posit middl bright white room head clutch desper hand moment vulner mani might odd antagonist megastar declar snatch award hand taylor swift make dramat outburst televis chat show week news broke singer hospitalis psychiatr ward ucla reportedli stress exhaust follow week errat behaviour stage subsequ cancel tour pressur artist conceal mental health vulner come almost unpreced scrutini west hospitalis come pivot time complex relationship mental health rather distanc west possibl mental health issu fellow musician chanc rapper west recent collabor told want extend special prayer brother kany west produc wonder tweet these respons suggest attitud stigma chang macho often adversari cultur coupl fact african american significantli less like seek help mental health issu meant public arena least rare discuss that ignor entir akeem sule consult psychiatrist becki inkster clinic neuroscientist univers cambridg recent initi psych academ research prove much lyric help peopl open mental health issu look origin realli understand much mental health alway core said sule inkster develop south bronx gang roam street drug epidem extrem poverti hous crisi throw absent father lose famili crime peopl support ingredi mental health problem pair point song tupac shakur mani tear speak impact environ mental health struggl cope well geto boy track mind play trick wide acknowledg psychosi howev dispar sule inkster point lyric document struggl depress differ stori came artist give interview perform there masculin cultur resili show sign weak said sule inkster while lyric spoke mental health problem covertli stigma particularli black live commun emerg say outright depress address mental health issu convers around mental health music industri open past coupl year particularli psycholog toll public evolv start own depress someth sign weak said sule inkster octob ohio rapper cudi made public statement hospitalis admit anxieti depress rule life long rememb difficult find word share feel asham wrote yesterday check rehab depress suicid urg scare feel like peopl sorri time nervou go wave support cudi receiv biggest name rocki travi scott khalifa even west fact gave rise trend hashtag #yougoodman discuss race masculin depress clear indic mental health stigma dissip accord inkster sule convers began open admit mani public struggl addict crime relat bipolar disord more recent evid rapper cole talk publicli struggl depress front #oknottobeok campaign chicago rapper mensa recent comment suppress mental health issu mental health someth peopl readi talk especi black commun especi black taboo outsid norm black think therapist anyth like said mensa recent charl hamilton rapper emerg great acclaim go collabor eminem among other publicli unravel later section bipolar disord return public last year spoke openli mental health issu trust anybodi leav hous made music time fight depress shut admit want commit career suicid physic suicid spiritu suicid care anymor inkster sule signific figur break stigma around depress reveal weak kendrick lamar arguabl world biggest artist said lamar public discuss inner demon survivor guilt fuell album pimp butterfli prove depress longer perceiv fallaci commun back earli day would never happen said still braggadocio lyric attitud would made great stride
43,"’One week left’ to pass Zika funding bill in US House, Democrats warn","The head of the Centers for Disease Control, congressional Democrats and the    at the Department of Homeland Security called for Republicans to bring a Zika funding bill to the floor  —   again. The call comes two weeks after a measure passed the House around 3am, loaded with unrelated provisions Democrats called “poison pills” and after the Senate attempted to advance a $1. 1bn bill.  “We’ve got one week left,” said Kathy Castor, a Democratic representative for the Tampa Bay area, along Florida’s Gulf Coast. The locality is at high risk for transmission of the disease. “One week left  —   and if Speaker [Paul] Ryan cannot get a bill to the president’s desk it will be a colossal failure to address a crisis. ”  The subtropical,   virus can cause children to be born with abnormally small heads, a devastating birth defect known as microcephaly. Researchers know little about the disease: there is no cure, no vaccine and few diagnostic tools.   Knowledge about how to control the mosquitoes that transmit Zika is also limited. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is prevalent along America’s Gulf Coast, but is less susceptible as to common mosquito control methods than other species.  “Would you believe that just yesterday we had 11 new cases in Florida,” said Democratic senator Bill Nelson. He and fellow Floridian, Republican Marco Rubio, attempted to bring a $1. 9bn bill to the floor earlier this year. The new diagnoses, Nelson said, “brings the state’s total to 263, which includes 43 pregnant women”. “It’s been 136 days since the president requested just under $2bn in emergency funding,” Nelson said. “Compare that it took just 38 days to get $6bn for Ebola, and it took just 49 days to get $2bn to respond to the swine flu in 2009. ”  The race to compromise on a Zika measure comes about one week before Congress adjourns for the summer. The House leaves Washington at 3pm on 15 July. The   disease was first flagged as dangerous in January, the World Health Organization declared it an emergency by February. Barack Obama requested $1. 9bn in funding the same month.  The money was proposed to develop a vaccine, research risks the virus poses, develop tools to diagnose usually asymptomatic infections, research effective mosquito control, develop public education, family planning and provide funds to   communities for mosquito monitoring.  Now, at the height of mosquito season, more than 1, 100 people across the US have been diagnosed with Zika. All the cases are “travel associated” where people were infected outside of the US. However, public health officials have said repeatedly the disease could jump to American mosquitoes if a   individual is bitten.  Just two weeks ago, the House passed a bill to fund Zika, but the measure was rejected by Democrats because of   provisions. Among the “poison pills” Democrats said, was a $540m cut in funding to Obamacare and a deleted provision to stop the Confederate flag from flying at federal veterans cemeteries. In turn, Republicans accused Democrats of failing to pass the bill despite what they billed as beneficial measures to lift restrictions on certain pesticides.  The medical head of the March of Dimes, which seeks to improve   health, said the cost of caring for a child with microcephaly could be especially crushing, up to $10m per child, about 40 times the average cost estimated by the USDA.  “One hundred babies would be $1bn,” said Dr Ed McCabe. “We’re quibbling over the cost of 100 of these babies. This funding could save these tragedies from occurring. ” A majority of Republicans and Democrats polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they support Zika research, but surveyors called Americans’ understanding of the virus “uneven”. Of the 85% of Americans who have heard of Zika, just 13% said they are personally threatened by it (74% said the virus threatens pregnant women). “The only virtue in watching an infectious disease spread in slow motion is that it should give some places the advantage of time to prepare for it,” McCabe said. “The US is on the brink of squandering that advantage. ” Public health officials are particularly concerned about how the stalemate could affect Puerto Rico, where the virus has infected island mosquitoes, and already hamstrung by a debt crisis. The director of the CDC, Dr Tom Frieden, said public health officials believe up to 15 women per day are infected with the virus. “What we are seeing in Puerto Rico today is a very rapid increase in the level of infection,” said Frieden. “This is a great concern, it’s a silent epidemic,” he said, because of the lack of tools to diagnose new infections.  To date nearly 2, 500 people in Puerto Rico have been diagnosed with the disease, including 279 pregnant women. There, a campaign to spray the island for mosquitoes has resulted in protests, according to the Puerto Rican news agency Primera Hora.",head center diseas control congression democrat depart homeland secur call republican bring zika fund bill floor call come week measur pass hous around load unrel provis democrat call poison pill senat attempt advanc bill week left said kathi castor democrat repres tampa area along florida gulf coast local high risk transmiss diseas week left speaker paul ryan cannot bill presid desk coloss failur address crisi subtrop viru caus children born abnorm small head devast birth defect known microcephali research know littl diseas cure vaccin diagnost tool knowledg control mosquito transmit zika also limit aed aegypti mosquito preval along america gulf coast less suscept common mosquito control method speci would believ yesterday case florida said democrat senat bill nelson fellow floridian republican marco rubio attempt bring bill floor earlier year diagnos nelson said bring state total includ pregnant women day sinc presid request emerg fund nelson said compar took day ebola took day respond swine race compromis zika measur come week congress adjourn summer hous leav washington juli diseas first flag danger januari world health organ declar emerg februari barack obama request fund month money propos develop vaccin research risk viru pose develop tool diagnos usual asymptomat infect research effect mosquito control develop public educ famili plan provid fund commun mosquito monitor height mosquito season peopl across diagnos zika case travel associ peopl infect outsid howev public health offici said repeatedli diseas could jump american mosquito individu bitten just week hous pass bill fund zika measur reject democrat provis among poison pill democrat said fund obamacar delet provis stop confeder flag fli feder veteran cemeteri turn republican accus democrat fail pass bill despit bill benefici measur lift restrict certain pesticid medic head march dime seek improv health said cost care child microcephali could especi crush child time averag cost estim usda hundr babi would said mccabe quibbl cost babi thi fund could save tragedi occur major republican democrat poll kaiser famili foundat said support zika research surveyor call american understand viru uneven american heard zika said person threaten said viru threaten pregnant women virtu watch infecti diseas spread slow motion give place advantag time prepar mccabe said brink squander advantag public health offici particularli concern stalem could affect puerto rico viru infect island mosquito alreadi hamstrung debt crisi director frieden said public health offici believ women infect viru what see puerto rico today rapid increas level infect said frieden thi great concern silent epidem said lack tool diagnos infect date nearli peopl puerto rico diagnos diseas includ pregnant women there campaign spray island mosquito result protest accord puerto rican news agenc primera hora
44,Police and protesters clash during squatters’ rights protest in Berlin,"More than 120 police officers were injured and 86 demonstrators detained during   riots in Berlin, which police have described as “the most aggressive and violent protests in the last five years”. Berlin police said in a statement on Sunday that protesters threw bottles, cobblestones and fireworks, destroyed cars and attacked officers, one of whom required hospital treatment. It wasn’t immediately clear how many rioters were injured. About 3, 500 protesters participated in the rallies, which started on Saturday evening and lasted until early on Sunday. Activists had called for the demonstration to protest against police operations at buildings inhabited by squatters in the eastern part of the German capital last month. About 1, 800 police officers were called in to monitor the protesters.",more polic offic injur demonstr detain riot berlin polic describ aggress violent protest last five year berlin polic said statement sunday protest threw bottl cobbleston firework destroy car attack offic requir hospit treatment immedi clear mani rioter injur about protest particip ralli start saturday even last earli sunday activist call demonstr protest polic oper build inhabit squatter eastern part german capit last month about polic offic call monitor protest
45,"Buddy Ryan, NFL coach and defensive mastermind, dies at 82","Buddy Ryan, the pugnacious coach who masterminded two fierce defenses that won Super Bowl titles and whose twin sons are   NFL coaches, died Tuesday. He was 82. His death was confirmed by the Buffalo Bills, who are coached by Rex Ryan. James Solano, Buddy Ryan’s agent, said he died in Kentucky but did not give a cause. Ryan lived on a ranch in Shelbyville. “Buddy was a legend in our league in so many ways,” the Bills said in a statement. “His defenses were innovative and he was a master at putting his talented and tough players in a position to succeed. He was a real game changer, and much of his philosophies and defensive tactics are still utilized effectively by teams today. ” Ryan was a linebackers coach for the 1968 New York Jets and coordinated the   46 defense for the ‘85 Chicago Bears, one of the NFL’s greatest defenses. He was a head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles from   and for the Arizona Cardinals in   compiling a    overall record. A few years ago, Ryan attended a   game, traveling to New Jersey despite cancer to see   head coach Rex go against   defensive coordinator Rob. James David Ryan was a Korean War veteran who went to Oklahoma State, then earned a master’s degree from Middle Tennessee State even while coaching. He got his first major job in the pros in New York, then of the AFL, in 1968. Ryan was the linebackers coach for the Joe   Jets, a boastful, confident team that fit his personality. Those Jets led the AFL in defense in his first season on staff, then shocked the Colts in the Super Bowl,  . “That’s something my dad was very proud of,” Rex said. “When [former Jets coach Weeb] Ewbank hired him, he had to make a difference. If he felt he wasn’t making a difference, then his career as a professional coach would be short. ” Instead, it was very long. Ryan’s first job as a defensive coordinator came in 1976 with the Vikings under Bud Grant, like Ewbank a Hall of Fame coach. He spent two years there before moving to the rival Bears, where he concocted the 46 defense that overwhelmed the league with its aggressiveness and unpredictability. Ryan’s defenders, featuring such Hall of Famers as linebacker Mike Singletary and ends Dan Hampton and Richard Dent, came from all angles and was nearly impossible to budge on the ground. Not that teams had more success in the air, either. “Some say the 46 is just an   front,” said Ryan, who named the scheme after safety Doug Plank, who wore that number. “That’s like saying Marilyn Monroe is just a girl. ” Ryan and head coach Mike Ditka often feuded during that   season and Super Bowl run. They nearly slugged it out at halftime of Chicago’s only defeat, at Miami on a Monday night in December. (Ryan would punch offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride on national TV on 2 January 1994 when both were assistant coaches in Houston.) His work in Chicago got Ryan the Eagles job. At a meeting the night before the Bears beat New England in the 1986 Super Bowl, Dent said a teary Ryan informed his players that he was going to Philadelphia: “You guys are going to be my champions. Let’s kick some tail,” Ryan said. Hampton then kicked a film projector out of defensive line coach Dale Haupt’s hands, and defensive tackle Steve McMichael flung a chair across the room, its legs impaling a chalkboard. Such was the devotion players felt for Ryan, who guided the Eagles to the playoffs in 1988, ‘89 and ‘90. But they lost all three playoff games, and he was fired after the 1990 season by Eagles owner Norman Braman despite a    record. Earlier that season, Ryan bragged that his Eagles would so badly beat up the Redskins in a Monday night game “they’ll have to be carted off in body bags. ” The Eagles’ defense scored three touchdowns in a   win and knocked nine Redskins out of the game, including two quarterbacks. A year earlier, Philadelphia routed the Cowboys   on Thanksgiving Day with hardly any holiday feelings in the air. Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas claimed Ryan put a $200 bounty on him, something Ryan laughed off as ridiculous. Arizona hired Ryan as head coach in 1994 and the Cardinals went   in his two years there. He never coached again, letting Rex and Rob carry on the family legacy. “Buddy’s influence will be carried on by defensive coaches for generations to come, but none more so than by Rex and Rob,” the Bills said. Ryan also is survived by another son, Jim, the Eagles said.",buddi ryan pugnaci coach mastermind fierc defens super bowl titl whose twin son coach die tuesday death confirm buffalo bill coach ryan jame solano buddi ryan agent said die kentucki give caus ryan live ranch shelbyvil buddi legend leagu mani way bill said statement defens innov master put talent tough player posit succeed real game changer much philosophi defens tactic still util effect team today ryan lineback coach york jet coordin defens chicago bear greatest defens head coach philadelphia eagl arizona cardin compil overal record year ryan attend game travel jersey despit cancer head coach defens coordin jame david ryan korean veteran went oklahoma state earn master degre middl tennesse state even coach first major pro york ryan lineback coach jet boast confid team person those jet defens first season staff shock colt super bowl that someth proud said when former jet coach weeb ewbank hire make differ felt make differ career profession coach would short instead long ryan first defens coordin came vike grant like ewbank hall fame coach spent year move rival bear concoct defens overwhelm leagu aggress unpredict ryan defend featur hall famer lineback mike singletari end hampton richard dent came angl nearli imposs budg ground team success either some front said ryan name scheme safeti doug plank wore number that like say marilyn monro girl ryan head coach mike ditka often feud season super bowl they nearli slug halftim chicago defeat miami monday night decemb ryan would punch offens coordin kevin gilbrid nation januari assist coach houston work chicago ryan eagl meet night bear beat england super bowl dent said teari ryan inform player go philadelphia guy go champion kick tail ryan said hampton kick film projector defens line coach dale haupt hand defens tackl steve mcmichael flung chair across room leg impal chalkboard such devot player felt ryan guid eagl playoff lost three playoff game fire season eagl owner norman braman despit record earlier season ryan brag eagl would badli beat redskin monday night game cart bodi bag eagl defens score three touchdown knock nine redskin game includ quarterback year earlier philadelphia rout cowboy thanksgiv hardli holiday feel cowboy kicker lui zendeja claim ryan bounti someth ryan laugh ridicul arizona hire ryan head coach cardin went year never coach let carri famili legaci buddi influenc carri defens coach gener come none bill said ryan also surviv anoth eagl said
46,Lee Daniels on ’whiny’ #OscarsSoWhite controversy: ’Stop complaining’,"    Lee Daniels has criticised the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, saying that people need to “stop complaining”. Daniels, whose film Precious made him only the second black director to have ever been nominated for an Oscar, has spoken about his frustration with those who claim the past two years of   nominees is a clear sign of industry racism. “Go out and do the work,” he said to the New York Times. “Oscars so white! So what? Do your work. Let your legacy speak and stop complaining, man. Are we really in this for the awards?” He also believes that a defeatist way of thinking about Hollywood would have prevented him from achieving success.  “If I had thought that way  —   that the world was against me  —   I wouldn’t be here now,” he said. “These whiny people that think we’re owed something are incomprehensible and reprehensible to me. I don’t expect acknowledgment or acceptance from white America. I’m going to be me. ” Daniels has since gone onto achieve success with the hit TV drama Empire and new show Star, for which he cast a white actor in the lead to help America feel more unified. “I felt that the country, instinctively, I thought, needed to heal,” he said in a recent interview. “And I thought that this white girl is so fabulous that black people will embrace her and white people will embrace her. ” The next set of Oscar nominations will be announced on 24 January, and experts are predicting a more diverse set of nominees with Moonlight, Fences and Hidden Figures all expected to be in the race.",daniel criticis #oscarssowhit controversi say peopl need stop complain daniel whose film preciou made second black director ever nomin oscar spoken frustrat claim past year nomine clear sign industri racism work said york time oscar white work legaci speak stop complain realli award also believ defeatist think hollywood would prevent achiev success thought world said these whini peopl think owe someth incomprehens reprehens expect acknowledg accept white america go daniel sinc gone onto achiev success drama empir show star cast white actor lead help america feel unifi felt countri instinct thought need heal said recent interview thought white girl fabul black peopl embrac white peopl embrac next oscar nomin announc januari expert predict divers nomine moonlight fenc hidden figur expect race
47,Transgender stories: ’People think we wake up and decide to be trans’,"Nikki Hayden, 26, psychology student, London, Until I was about four or five I didn’t know I wasn’t a girl, to be honest with you. One of my earliest memories, about five years old, was being yelled at by a teacher for going to the toilet with the girls. About the same age I realised I was different to these other boys. At the age of nine I refused to have my hair cut. I didn’t have it cut until I was 16, because having it cut was such a torment to me. School was extremely difficult. I got bullied a lot. I was picked on for being too thin, for being feminine, for not liking football, for hanging round with girls, for having long hair. They mocked everything they could think of in terms of gender and sexuality. I learned what trans meant through YouTube. I knew how I felt but I didn’t know there was a term for it. I was basically just trying to Google what I felt. A lightbulb went off in my head and I thought, this explains all the issues I’ve had as long as I can remember. I never really told my family. They know, but I just started transitioning. I never said: “Oh, by the way   …    ” My mum asked me if I was transgender when I was around 19 after I’d already transitioned. She said: “Well, are you?” And I was like: “Are you blind?” On a    basis I don’t tell people I’m transgender. The thing about trans people is, we feel very normal. It’s the way we are, it’s only when people say you’re not normal that you feel that way. I’ve always been extremely feminine, I always felt that way. I can’t say that I ever felt like a boy, I just had to live as a boy for the first 16 years of my life. Trans people are the same as everyone else, our ideals in life are to be happy, to be respected, to be comfortable. I’ve had people who have openly said to me that they’ve had prejudices around trans people but as soon as they’ve met me they’ve understood more  —   it’s who I am and the way that I was born. There’s no real difference between myself and people who are cisgender [ ]. Keith Reynolds, 18, student, Surrey, A lot of people have it in their head that we wake up and decide to be trans. I want people to know that it’s not a choice. Nothing has happened in my life to make me trans. I was born trans. I told my mum when I was about 13. She was shocked and didn’t really understand. Then six months later she told my dad and he was so angry. I love my dad but he was a very traditional person. There was a lot of tension. I couldn’t wear men’s clothing, or I couldn’t wear men’s deodorant  —   it would cause an argument. It started to get better, but then Dad got cancer. He died a week before I turned 16. When he got sick we didn’t talk about it any more. I thought that once he had recovered we’d go back to talking about it, but he didn’t recover. After my dad died I found a book about transgender young people and I gave it to my mum. She read it and it was a complete change. She says her main thing and also my dad’s main thing is they were worried about how it will affect me in life  —   will I be able to find a job, will I be able to find a partner. Well, those things have happened: I’ve found a partner, I have no trouble finding jobs. My mum is fantastic, she’s really proud of me. She comes to Transgender Pride with me, if anybody says anything bad about me being trans she’s ready to hammer them. She makes me the envy of many trans people, I think. I was referred to Tavistock [the clinic for children and adolescents] in May 2014. You’re not allowed testosterone until you’ve been on hormone blockers for a year at Tavistock. But I was 16 at my first appointment and had already gone through puberty, and knew that by the time I had done a year on blockers I’d be picked up by the adult clinics. I decided not to go on hormone blockers, because it wouldn’t really do much for me. I was referred to an adult clinic in May 2015. I still haven’t had an appointment, which means I haven’t had any medical intervention in three years. I’m desperate for hormones and surgery. My dysphoria makes me feel like I’m embarrassed for people to look at me. In my head I’m this weird thing that is ugly. I have to wear baggy clothes to hide my hips, I have to think about how many layers I have to wear to hide my chest. I really understand that the NHS is overstretched because there’s a sudden influx of people being referred. I completely understand why, but that doesn’t stop the frustration.   Knan, 40s, project manager for Liberal Judaism, London, I didn’t really know anything about gender identity until quite late, when I was in my  . I also come from a secular Jewish family, so I didn’t know much about what it means to be Jewish either.  I identify as    . Being trans and Jewish seemed a complete oxymoron. I thought, it can’t be, I have to decide between them. But I had this wonderful community here to give me all that space and time to come out. I feel very blessed that everyone, including family and friends, have been extremely supportive throughout. I haven’t had to go through what many trans people have to go through. Years ago when I came out I went to the wall [Western Wall in Jerusalem]. There are three sections  —   the male section, the female section and an ungendered section. Now I would probably go to the ungendered section, but it was my first time presenting as male in such a holy place and I went to the male section of the wall. It made me so happy to do that, to go to the part of the wall I wanted to. I was transitioning medically and spiritually and it was one of the most important moments of my life. A Jewish online magazine reported on that and it sparked off online, I got really abusive messages. I thought, these people don’t know me, I don’t think anyone should be able to tell you who you are and how to live your life. Yourself is yourself, even in the religious community.  A lot of people from mainstream trans communities ask me, how can you be a person of faith, because even your own religion has been so horrible to LGBT people in general and trans people specifically? That’s true. But it’s about what faith means and leaving out what some leaders and institutions do with it.  In the media, the focus is often on the pathology and medical transitioning and that’s a big part of it, but there are so many layers of what it means to be trans. It’s almost like trans people are   they are just these people who need medical help. I do hope we will change our view on what trans looks like. It’s not just something on the outside, it’s something that’s very deep and spiritual. We are created in the image of God. I am part of that as a trans Jew.   Bishop OBE, 70, retired sales manager, scientific instrumentation, Rhyl, Wales  I knew I was trans from about three or four years old. From a very early age I thought one day I’ll wake up and my body will be like my sisters’ and my parents would say: “Oh, we had a girl, not a boy as we thought. ” When I went to university I learned about transsexuals and that some of them transitioned. I brought this up with my tutors and they said: “People like you don’t do that. ” They said: “Just get married and it’ll all go away. ” That was the perceived wisdom then  —   they told gay and lesbian people the same thing. So I was persuaded that I should get married. Within three or four months I told my ex how I felt and initially she was very supportive. I used to go to a support group once a week I’d have a weekend out once a month where I’d get dressed up and go clubbing with some other girls in Manchester. I had to travel a lot for work, which gave me opportunities to be myself. These coping strategies kept me going through about 30 years of marriage. When they found out at work I’d regularly lose my job. It’s happened five times, most recently after the equality legislation had been passed. One time, very early on, I was coming back from my support group at night. I got stopped by police at a routine roadblock. The officer asked if I was allowed to drive a company vehicle dressed like that and called my work to tell them I was dressed like a woman. I had one job where they got rid of me and then they wrote to every company I applied to and said: “Don’t employ this person, they’re trans. ” Each time I lost my job we had to move. The last time it happened my wife wouldn’t move any more  —   that’s what really ended our marriage. When I transitioned   [in 2007] we had difficulties like having the car regularly damaged and having “the trannies live here” painted on the house. When I moved to north Wales to live with my trans partner, Elen, no one knew me as anyone else, so almost all the abuse stopped. Elen and I got married in 2011. There’s still so much to do, but there have been huge improvements in acceptance. There is much more legislation to support us, particularly in the last few years. That night I got outed by the police officer, I wouldn’t have even dared go into the police station as myself. Now I go in and have lunch with the assistant chief constable or the police and crime commissioner to discuss combating transphobic hate crime. J Fernandez, 23, administrative assistant, London,  The people you see in the media are usually one type of trans person. They’re usually binary [identify as either female or male] they usually pass [as someone of that gender] they’re usually white and they usually have this narrative that they’ve always known they’re the “wrong gender”. It makes other trans people scared to tell their stories.    people are people who don’t identify as male or female all the time. There are lots of subsections  —   you might be agender, gender fluid,   a   or a  . You might not understand the nuances of the differences, but everyone is always making up new identities to match their experiences and that can only be a good thing. While it can be confusing, it’s better than saying you can only be this thing and we won’t talk about anything else.  I just identify as   and don’t put myself into any sub identity. Some days I like to be a woman and I’m also OK with identifying as being a guy. I’m pretty much nothing at the moment. I came out as a trans guy and transitioned. I took testosterone, I’ve had top surgery [chest reduction] and then a hysterectomy in 2015. The hormones and surgery is about aligning my body to what it should have been at birth. Being born with the correct parts would have made things easier, but at the same time I don’t want to be told that my body is wrong.  It’s very difficult to get treatment as a   person. They were dismissive about the fact that I was feminine.   people are used to it, you are warned when you go in [to the gender clinics] if you want treatment you will have to present as male or female and stick to that story. I don’t want to be part of any mainstream [ ] movement if it doesn’t include   people. In terms of celebrity, there needs to be a lot more diversity. It’s a circle: people don’t come out if they don’t see anyone like them. I’m  : my mum is Spanish and Nigerian. I am still finding out how I connect with an identity apart from a western LGBT identity. That’s something I’m still working on. Within the religion indigenous to the Yoruba people [an ethnic group in Nigeria] there a lot of gender fluid deities as a trans person trying to find my roots, that’s one part of my heritage that I

48,Rolling Stone ’Jackie’ trial: university administrator awarded $3m for defamation,"Jurors have awarded a University of Virginia administrator $3m for her portrayal in a   Rolling Stone magazine article about the school’s handling of a brutal gang rape a fraternity house. The   jury’s decision came after they concluded on Friday that the magazine, its publisher and reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely were responsible for defamation, with actual malice, of former associate dean of students Nicole Eramo in the 2014 story A Rape on Campus. Eramo sued the magazine for $7. 5m, claiming it cast her as a villain who sought to discourage the woman identified only as Jackie from reporting her alleged assault to police. A police investigation found no evidence to back up Jackie’s rape claims. Jurors heard testimony on Monday about the extent to which the story has damaged Eramo’s life and reputation before they began deliberating to decide how much to award her in damages. Eramo told jurors that after the story’s publication, she had trouble sleeping, feared for her safety and struggled with how to explain what was happening to her     son. One day, she crawled under her desk and contemplated suicide as she felt her world come crashing down around her, she said. Her husband testified that she told him: “I don’t know that I can live anymore. ” “I just wanted to disappear,” said Eramo, who cried throughout much of her testimony. “I didn’t know how it was going to be OK. ” She claimed the article prompted the university to move her out of her job as an associate dean into a different administrative role that she doesn’t like as much because she rarely works with students. When the article was published, she was also preparing to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer. Eramo and her attorneys suggested that the stress she was under could have contributed to a   infection that led to a hospital stay. “Even the strongest people have a breaking point,” said Tom Clare, an attorney for Eramo. The story roiled the University of Virginia campus, prompted calls for Eramo’s resignation and sparked a national conversation about sexual assault at elite institutions. Jackie’s story quickly fell apart after reporters from other outlets started asking questions and determined that Rolling Stone never spoke to the woman’s alleged attackers  —   or even verified their existence  —   before going to print. Because the judge determined that Eramo was a public figure, she had to prove Rolling Stone made statements with “actual malice,” meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or entertained serious doubts about whether it might be true. Jurors found that the magazine and its publisher, Wenner Media, acted with actual malice because they republished the article on 5 December with an editor’s note after they knew about the problems with Jackie’s story. The jury also found that Erdely acted with actual malice on six claims: two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story was published. Jurors awarded $2m to Eramo for statements made by Erdely and $1m for the republication of the article by Rolling Stone and Wenner Media. Rolling Stone could appeal the verdict. Rolling Stone has agreed to pay Erdely’s legal costs and the damages levied against her. Rolling Stone’s attorneys argued throughout the   trial that while it may have been a mistake to trust Jackie, their portrayal of the university and Eramo was fair and accurate. On Monday, attorney David Paxton told jurors that the magazine was “heartbroken” by Friday’s decision and urged them not to be tempted to award a large sum of damages in order to send a message to the magazine and the media. They’ve already done that with their verdict, Paxton said. “This was tough medicine to receive,” Paxton said. Paxton apologized to Eramo, but stressed that Eramo not only kept a job at the university after the article was published, but she received a pay raise. In their damages defense, attorneys for Rolling Stone showed jurors just one exhibit: A 2015 Office of Civil Rights report that criticizes the university’s handling of sexual assault complaints and specifically mentions that Eramo helped to create a “hostile environment” for victims on campus. Rolling Stone also faces a $25m lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity where Jackie claimed her assault took place. That case is schedule to go to trial late next year.",juror award univers virginia administr portray roll stone magazin articl school handl brutal gang rape fratern hous juri decis came conclud friday magazin publish report sabrina rubin erd respons defam actual malic former associ dean student nicol eramo stori rape campu eramo su magazin claim cast villain sought discourag woman identifi jacki report alleg assault polic polic investig found evid back jacki rape claim juror heard testimoni monday extent stori damag eramo life reput began deliber decid much award damag eramo told juror stori public troubl sleep fear safeti struggl explain happen crawl desk contempl suicid felt world come crash around said husband testifi told know live anymor want disappear said eramo cri throughout much testimoni know go claim articl prompt univers move associ dean differ administr role like much rare work student when articl publish also prepar undergo doubl mastectomi breast cancer eramo attorney suggest stress could contribut infect hospit stay even strongest peopl break point said clare attorney eramo stori roil univers virginia campu prompt call eramo resign spark nation convers sexual assault elit institut jacki stori quickli fell apart report outlet start ask question determin roll stone never spoke woman alleg attack even verifi exist go print becaus judg determin eramo public figur prove roll stone made statement actual malic mean knew write fals entertain seriou doubt whether might true juror found magazin publish wenner media act actual malic republish articl decemb editor note knew problem jacki stori juri also found erd act actual malic claim statement articl four statement media outlet stori publish juror award eramo statement made erd republ articl roll stone wenner media roll stone could appeal verdict roll stone agre erd legal cost damag levi roll stone attorney argu throughout trial mistak trust jacki portray univers eramo fair accur monday attorney david paxton told juror magazin heartbroken friday decis urg tempt award larg damag order send messag magazin media they alreadi done verdict paxton said thi tough medicin receiv paxton said paxton apolog eramo stress eramo kept univers articl publish receiv rais damag defens attorney roll stone show juror exhibit offic civil right report critic univers handl sexual assault complaint specif mention eramo help creat hostil environ victim campu roll stone also face lawsuit kappa fratern jacki claim assault took place that case schedul trial late next year
49,Sausage Party review – Seth Rogen’s surprisingly tasty supermarket sweep,"Talk about fresh. Seth Rogen’s naughty food cartoon Sausage Party is, like much of his best work, deceptive packaging. The script he and his usual collaborator Evan Goldberg have written (in conjunction with Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir) seems, at first, to trade solely on anthropomorphised food using profanity on supermarket shelves. This is mildly amusing at first but, like a bun out of its Cellophane, threatens to go stale. That’s when a jar of honey mustard gets returned. The supermarket is what Erving Goffman might call a total institution. Its occupants (food from around the world) are kept compliant by an unprovable belief system. If they are good and obey the gods, they will one day be chosen and taken to the “Great Beyond” (outside the gleaming automated doors in a cart.) But they will only get picked if they remain pure of spirit the “unfresh” get tossed into a dusty bin by a sadist tormentor (actually just a teen bored with his job.) This fear prevents sausages and buns from getting intimate, despite their urges to conjoin. This is all preposterous, but stick with it it’s just the tip of surprisingly thorough   in this   comedy. Our lead sausage Frank (voiced by Rogen) is upbeat, cheery and randy for his shelfmate Brenda (Kristen Wiig) a bun who returns his affection. All is well at the store, with the happy food singing songs of praise to the gods who will one day scoop them up. (Unlike Toy Story, where humans are never around to catch the living toys, humans just can’t see the true reality.) But when that shellshocked honey mustard (Danny McBride) returns with stories of the gods actually being bloodthirsty monsters, things start to change. The first of a number of extraordinary   comes when our heroes end up selected (yay!) but an overturned cart leads to chaos. A punctured bag of white flour provides a    cloud. There is a shocking amount of proper, terrorising fear during this and subsequent scenes. There has to be for the comedy to work. I’d personally be OK allowing children to see the goofy prurience in this film, but it’s the horrific imagery (some of which apes Saving Private Ryan) that might freak a kid out. Disrupted, Frank and Brenda must get back to their aisle in the hopes of repackaging themselves without getting tossed. On their march they are joined by a Jewish bagel (Edward Norton doing the most    Woody Allen impersonation since Rick Moranis) and an Arabic lavash (David Krumholtz) whose belief in the Great Beyond includes being doused in 77 bottles of virgin olive oil. The pair bicker (“You’ve even occupied the West Bank of the aisle! ”) and as the foursome make tracks, they discover they are being hunted by an angry vaginal douche. The douche, sleazily voiced by Nick Kroll, is a play on    . (Yes, there’s a scene where he gets “juiced. ”) Racial stereotypes await on every aisle, which will undoubtedly be a third rail for some viewers. My attitude is that if you want to play in that sandbox, you have to be sure to insult everyone and, more importantly, make sure the jokes work. Sausage Party features an adorable potato (with googly eyes all over its body!) happily singing Danny Boy, then, just before a surprise peeling, shouting, “Jaysus Fook!” I dunno   …     there are some things in this world that are beautiful. There’s a lot that’s goofy in Sausage Party, like when a doper on bath salts can suddenly see and hear the living food in his house, and a Stephen   piece of   bubblegum, but there is (I swear) a richer message, too. This is a     story that is vehemently against the corruption found in organised religion, but not in a    “atheist”      Gervais kind of way. In fact, if there’s any message in the movie, it’s that even if you think someone else is being dumb, you aren’t going to win them over by rubbing their noses in their stupidity. Something to consider right now as we get closer to an election where one candidate’s supporters seem too stupid to tie their own shoes. And another message: everyone would probably be happier if they were screwing. Sausage Party is a movie with an extended climax, and before the final ending there’s an already much discussed “food orgy” that, no joke, is something you need to see to believe. The whole thing is so tasty, you may just want seconds.",talk fresh seth rogen naughti food cartoon sausag parti like much best work decept packag script usual collabor evan goldberg written conjunct kyle hunter ariel shaffir seem first trade sole anthropomorphis food use profan supermarket shelv thi mildli amus first like cellophan threaten stale that honey mustard get return supermarket erv goffman might call total institut occup food around world kept compliant unprov belief system good obey god chosen taken great beyond outsid gleam autom door cart pick remain pure spirit unfresh toss dusti sadist tormentor actual teen bore thi fear prevent sausag bun get intim despit urg conjoin thi preposter stick surprisingli thorough comedi lead sausag frank voic rogen upbeat cheeri randi shelfmat brenda kristen wiig return affect well store happi food sing song prais god scoop unlik stori human never around catch live toy human true realiti shellshock honey mustard danni mcbride return stori god actual bloodthirsti monster thing start chang first number extraordinari come hero select overturn cart lead chao punctur white flour provid cloud there shock amount proper terroris fear subsequ scene there comedi work person allow children goofi prurienc film horrif imageri ape save privat ryan might freak disrupt frank brenda must back aisl hope repackag without get toss march join jewish bagel edward norton woodi allen imperson sinc rick morani arab lavash david krumholtz whose belief great beyond includ dous bottl virgin oliv pair bicker even occupi west bank aisl foursom make track discov hunt angri vagin douch douch sleazili voic nick kroll play scene get juic racial stereotyp await everi aisl undoubtedli third rail viewer attitud want play sandbox sure insult everyon importantli make sure joke work sausag parti featur ador potato googli eye bodi happili sing danni surpris peel shout jaysu fook dunno thing world beauti there goofi sausag parti like doper bath salt suddenli hear live food hous stephen piec bubblegum swear richer messag thi stori vehement corrupt found organis religion atheist gervai kind fact messag movi even think someon els dumb go rub nose stupid someth consid right closer elect candid support seem stupid shoe anoth messag everyon would probabl happier screw sausag parti movi extend climax final end alreadi much discuss food orgi joke someth need believ whole thing tasti want second
50,Georgetown’s attempt at atonement: should we be grateful?,"Slavery is a footnote in the history of many universities in the United States. Mostly, that’s where it stays. But not for Georgetown, which sold 272 slaves in 1838. The university wants to come to terms with its past and take the abstract concepts of reconciliation and redemption and make them tangible. Will they succeed? In their announcement, I heard the buzzwords “diversity” and “inclusion” several times, and those trend words put me on edge. Organizations use those terms all the time and little comes from the effort to make elitist and exclusionary circles more accessible. I was also turned off by the school’s decision to grant the slaves’ descendants legacy access without any guaranteed financial support. The arrangement means that even if an applicant and his or her family are able to overcome many of the systemic and institutional injustices that African Americans faced in the wake of slavery, the chance to attend Georgetown might still be compromised due to finances. I know it is impossible to place a price tag on demoralization and dehumanization. There is no calculator that can account for the cultural and economic legacies of slavery and discrimination. Yet every couple years there’s the talk of reparations. A recent article by Yes! Magazine estimates that the “40 acres and a mule” promise would be worth $6. 4tn. But we are far off from seriously considering that kind of justice.  So do we take what atonement we can get and then hold institutions accountable? In a world where white students are ready to challenge affirmative action, and people question racism’s existence even as we watch people being shot and murdered for misdemeanors, that might be the pragmatic approach. Georgetown’s decision could forever change the way we talk about inheritance, legacy and community. The university has decided to invest part of its endowment in unpacking the complex issue of slavery, and the racial inequality the system of selling human cargo created. The move could cause other educational and cultural giants to assess their privilege and question their historical and cultural competency.  Imagine what we could accomplish as a community, and as a nation, if we spent time reflecting upon our country’s darker historical moments as tool to create a better future. Would the world implode if we were able to recognize that slavery was part of the social order, the social construct that our systems were built upon? No. But it would give our current system a strong and   shake.  After all, people argued with Michelle Obama when she mentioned that the White House was built by slaves, without knowing that it actually was. And Colin Kaepernick catches flack for his decision to sit during the national anthem to protest the treatment of minorities in the US. But few of his critics know that the lyricist of The Star Spangled Banner, Francis Scott Key, was a slaveholder when the song was composed in 1814. We need this because many in the US are ready to join the debate about the burkini ban, forgetting that just a few decade ago, African Americans weren’t allowed to swim in public pools. Does an admission like Georgetown’s fill the desire for healing and reconciliation that the nation needs? Maybe not, but it is the start to a   conversation.",slaveri footnot histori mani univers unit state mostli stay georgetown sold slave univers want come term past take abstract concept reconcili redempt make tangibl will succeed announc heard buzzword divers inclus sever time trend word edg organ term time littl come effort make elitist exclusionari circl access also turn school decis grant slave descend legaci access without guarante financi support arrang mean even applic famili abl overcom mani system institut injustic african american face wake slaveri chanc attend georgetown might still compromis financ know imposs place price demor dehuman there calcul account cultur econom legaci slaveri discrimin everi coupl year talk repar recent articl magazin estim acr mule promis would worth serious consid kind justic take aton hold institut account world white student readi challeng affirm action peopl question racism exist even watch peopl shot murder misdemeanor might pragmat approach georgetown decis could forev chang talk inherit legaci commun univers decid invest part endow unpack complex issu slaveri racial inequ system sell human cargo creat move could caus educ cultur giant assess privileg question histor cultur compet imagin could accomplish commun nation spent time reflect upon countri darker histor moment tool creat better futur would world implod abl recogn slaveri part social order social construct system built upon would give current system strong shake after peopl argu michel obama mention white hous built slave without know actual colin kaepernick catch flack decis nation anthem protest treatment minor critic know lyricist star spangl banner franci scott slavehold song compos need mani readi join debat burkini forget decad african american allow swim public pool doe admiss like georgetown fill desir heal reconcili nation need mayb start convers
51,Chicago man killed while live streaming video on Facebook Live,"A Chicago man was shot and killed while live streaming a video on Facebook, police said on Friday, just days after a double homicide in France in which the killer later took to Facebook Live to encourage more violence. Antonio Perkins, 28, was found face down on Wednesday night in a vacant lot with gunshot wounds to the neck and head on the city’s west side, Chicago police officer Laura Amezaga said.  Perkins was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police on Friday identified the man in the video as Perkins, who they said was a documented gang member. No arrests have been made.  In France, a    man killed a French police commander and the commander’s partner on Tuesday, then he took to Facebook Live with a   video encouraging followers to kill prison staff, police officials, journalists and lawmakers. The incidents underscore the immense challenges companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube face as they push live video streaming to hundreds of millions of people.  Facebook in recent months has made its Live feature  —   which allows anyone to broadcast a video in real time  —   a central component of its strategy. It allows people to stream from their smartphone.  Chicago, the   US city, has drawn attention due to its gun violence, which police have blamed largely on gang violence and a proliferation of stolen guns. There were nearly 500 homicides last year, and gun violence is up in 2016, police say.  The Facebook Live video appears to show Perkins recording himself and a group of people in front of a row of homes before someone opened fire. The phone appears to tumble through bloody grass before going black. The audio continues with bystanders screaming and crying.  The video remains on Facebook with a user warning message about its graphic nature.  A spokeswoman from Facebook acknowledged the video posting, saying it does not violate company policy. The social media site will remove a video if it celebrates or glorifies violence, she said.",chicago shot kill live stream video facebook polic said friday day doubl homicid franc killer later took facebook live encourag violenc antonio perkin found face wednesday night vacant gunshot wound neck head citi west side chicago polic offic laura amezaga said perkin taken hospit pronounc dead polic friday identifi video perkin said document gang member arrest made franc kill french polic command command partner tuesday took facebook live video encourag follow kill prison staff polic offici journalist lawmak incid underscor immens challeng compani facebook twitter googl youtub face push live video stream hundr million peopl facebook recent month made live featur allow anyon broadcast video real time central compon strategi allow peopl stream smartphon chicago citi drawn attent violenc polic blame larg gang violenc prolifer stolen gun there nearli homicid last year violenc polic facebook live video appear show perkin record group peopl front home someon open fire phone appear tumbl bloodi grass go black audio continu bystand scream cri video remain facebook user warn messag graphic natur spokeswoman facebook acknowledg video post say violat compani polici social media site remov video celebr glorifi violenc said
52,Nate Parker: director with a back story,"When Nate Parker “arrived” with the screening of his film The Birth of a Nation at the Sundance festival in January, the timing couldn’t have been more urgent. Ten days before its unveiling, #OscarsSoWhite had begun to trend again on Twitter. For the second year in a row, no actors of colour were nominated for an Academy Award. Here was an   picture from a   African American film‑maker, featuring a mostly black cast, and centring on Nat Turner, a former slave who led a brutally violent revolt in 1831 to free slaves in Virginia. The film had the potential to seize the moment  —   and it did. The Sundance screening was key. Parker had ensured that cast, crew, friends and family made the trek to Park City, Utah, for his film’s premiere. Their energy was felt in the room. Before the screening even got under way, the crowd stood as soon as Parker’s name was called. Once it concluded, a second, and much longer, ovation followed, with many in attendance seen drying their tears. Immediate reactions on Twitter were ecstatic. A bidding war between the hottest arthouse distributors followed. Fox Searchlight, the company that led the similarly themed 12 Years a Slave to a best picture Oscar win in 2014, was the victor, purportedly beating Netflix to land the film for $17. 5m (a colossal amount by Sundance standards). Its aim in spending so much was clear: The Birth of a Nation would be their great Oscar hope. It came as no surprise when the film won the grand jury prize as well as the audience award no other selection came close to matching its impact on the industry during the   span of the festival. It seemed nothing could possibly derail’s Parker’s rise from   actor to Hollywood’s new hope. Imagine, then, the shockwaves that reverberated through Hollywood when Parker publicly addressed a rape trial from his college years in two trade interviews tied to his impending awards campaign. Before he spoke out about the 1999 incident to Variety and Deadline, two of Hollywood’s most trusted sources, few were aware of the rape charge, of which he had been cleared. Suddenly, Parker’s past troubles threaten to tarnish his passion project. Parker was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the same state where Turner was born into slavery, a fact Parker only discovered when he took African American studies at college. “Imagine my dismay,” he told the Hollywood Reporter before arriving at Sundance, “in learning that one of the greatest men to walk the soil in this country was a man who grew up and lived and breathed and fought less than 100 miles from where I grew up. ” His mother Carolyn  —   she was 17 years old when she gave birth to Parker  —   is a devout Christian, exerting a huge influence on Parker, now himself father to five young children. Speaking to Christianity Today Parker relayed what he viewed as the spiritual significance of The Birth of a Nation: “If you’re able to view this film without the baggage of racism, then it’s very clearly a story of someone that was compelled by his faith to act as the hand of the God through his interpretation. ” Carolyn never married Parker’s biological father, instead first wedding the man who would give Parker his surname she later married Walter Whitfield, an air force man, who uprooted his new family to Maine. When Parker was 11, his biological father, with whom he’d kept in touch, died of cancer with little warning. His death, coupled with all the changes, proved to be a lot for Parker, according to his mother, who has said that her son became “quite depressed”. He channelled his depression into anger, taking his demons out on classmates during his teenage years by beating them up at school. “It wasn’t just rage,” Parker recalled. “It was just being a kid that needed some kind of clarity. ” Aged 14, unable to bond with his new stepfather, Carolyn had her son return to Virginia to live with her brother Jay Combs, a former wrestler, who encouraged Parker to join his high school’s wrestling team. Parker was a natural at the sport and landed a full wrestling scholarship to Pennsylvania State University. It was at the beginning of his second year, in 1999, when he and Jean Celestin, a friend from the wrestling team, were charged with the rape and sexual assault of an    female student, who claimed to have been unconscious during the alleged attack. As the case went viral on campus, the pair were suspended from the team. Parker, who had had an earlier sexual encounter with the woman, which both said was consensual, was acquitted of the charges in 2001, while Celestin was found guilty of sexual assault, before being granted a new trial in 2005. That case never came to court after prosecutors balked at tracking down all the former witnesses. Court documents show that the woman said she was harassed by Parker and Celestin after she reported the incident to the police. She dropped out of college as a result. It’s since been revealed that the woman at the centre of the case, who had a child, killed herself in 2012. Parker responded to the development on his Facebook page, saying he was “devastated”. “As a    father of daughters and person of faith, I look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom,” he wrote. After the trial, Parker transferred to the University of Oklahoma, where he earned a degree in management science and information systems, and quickly landed work designing websites. He had no aspirations to become an actor  —   instead he was roped into a newfound career after being approached by Jon Simmons, the agent who still represents him, at a talent search in Dallas, Texas, where his friend, an aspiring model, was hoping to get a gig. The story goes that Simmons had Parker   a scene from The Fast and the Furious and Parker was hooked. “The way it made me feel, it was like winning a match times a hundred,” he told the  . Naturally, he relocated to Los Angeles. Parker’s enviable bone structure and toned figure were noticed immediately, landing him small roles despite the fact he had no prior acting experience. In 2007, he put his athletic frame to use in the   drama Pride, which saw him act opposite Terrence Howard. His charisma impressed Denzel Washington, who cast him a year later in The Great Debaters, where Parker delivered a breakthrough performance as a student on an   debating team in 1935. From there, more   supporting performances followed: for Spike Lee, he ventured to Brooklyn in Red Hook Summer (2012) he conspired with Richard Gere in the financial thriller Arbitrage the same year. Despite his popularity, Parker soon arrived at a crossroads, uninspired creatively by the roles he was being offered. “So few of them had integrity,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “As a black man, you leave auditions not hoping you get the job but wondering how you explain it to your family if you do. ” Once shooting on Beyond the Lights (2014) wrapped, Parker met his agents to tell them he would not be accepting any more projects until he could get his own film about American revolutionary Nat Turner off the ground. He stuck to his word, not working for two years on anything but what would come to be known as The Birth of a Nation, provocatively named after DW Griffith’s notoriously racist 1915 film. Parker had written and directed a couple of short films putting together a feature posed a foreign challenge. To get it all rolling, he invested $100, 000 of his own money before securing backers, including retired NBA player Michael Finley. The future of The Birth of Nation remains in doubt. Parker is expected to promote the film as planned, taking it to the Toronto international film festival in September, followed by a tour to churches and campusescorrect around the US, where he’ll discuss the issues of social justice raised by the film. But as awards season expert and Indiewire’s    Anne Thompson notes, the issue of rape “is going to keep coming up” despite Parker’s wishes to the contrary. (He told Deadline: “I will not relive that period of my life every time I go under the microscope. ”) There’s no avoiding it, argues Thompson, because Turner’s quest for retribution is largely set in motion because of a horrific rape. Thompson believes there’s “no precedent” for the situation Parker finds himself in. “The pattern with more established people in Hollywood is forgive and forget,” she says, citing Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, both of whom were also embroiled in rape controversies and yet managed to maintain their standing. “The larger Hollywood community doesn’t know Nate Parker. And they need to find out who he is. ” As for the general public, many might find the very idea of worrying about Hollywood’s assessment  —   or debates about the quality of the film  —   secondary concerns in the circumstances. • Comments will be opened later today, Born Nathaniel Emanuel Combs, 18 November, 1979 in Norfolk, Virginia.

53,FBI stands guilty of an overtly political act at a crucial moment,"Democratic party outrage at the FBI’s shock revelation, almost on the eve of the US presidential election, that it is resuming its controversial investigation of Hillary Clinton after declaring in July that the matter was closed, has been fierce. Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the Democratic national committee, was one of many to cry foul. “The FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters. Even the faintest appearance of using the agency’s power to influence our election is deeply troubling,” she said. John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chief, also hinted at skulduggery: “It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. ” Podesta said the FBI statement left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to investigate. This may well be true. In his letter of notification to Congress, James Comey, the FBI director, said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that Clinton acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from  . Comey said the new emails “appear to be pertinent” but he and his officials had not yet examined them. In a later statement, he admitted “we don’t know the significance” of the emails, but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public. It is not even certain that the emails came from Clinton’s private server. Comey’s move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical. FBI investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors. Only when a decision to prosecute has been taken, based on persuasive evidence, is an inquiry made public or suspects named. For a respected, ostensibly independent figure like the FBI director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly political, partisan act. Since it must be assumed that Comey is no fool, it must also be assumed that he knew what he was doing. A less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the FBI (and himself) further criticism from the Republican right, which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a    . But if that is the case, why did Comey not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight committees? Nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a  . And he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the FBI’s impartiality is again being questioned, and this time from the left. Whatever Comey’s reasons, the damage is done. Clinton must now try to weather the storm until 8 November, having previously believed that she was in the clear. It will be a rough ride. The ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a frenetic, furious and   finale. Donald Trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in. Speaking on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee revived jibes that Clinton is a corrupt and habitual liar. In typically hyperbolic terms, he said that her conduct was “the biggest scandal since Watergate”. As usual, Trump’s risible exaggeration undermines his case. But the genuine anger and alarm expressed by Clinton’s surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially be. Although in Trump she faces the least qualified and, for a host of reasons, most objectionable Republican candidate in living memory, Clinton is still only about 5% ahead in the polls, as a national average. This bald figure may be considered misleading. In 14 battleground or “swing” states, where the electoral college will be decided, Clinton is ahead in all but Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. But polls across the nation are tightening. This latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive (or in some cases, to dish her) will not help. Despite her advantages in experience, name recognition, political achievement and spending power, Clinton has evidently failed to knock Trump out of the race. Despite a deeply damaging few weeks for Trump, when he was beset by allegations of sexual misconduct, he still appears, amazingly, to be in with a shot. A more skilled and savvy politician than Clinton could and would have buried Trump months ago. A more charismatic, popular or likeable Democratic   could now be awaiting electoral coronation. This latest blow may cause some underwhelmed Democrats to abstain. And Clinton’s best pitch to sceptical independent and undecided voters  —   that she is the least worst candidate  —   leaves her vulnerable to a   upset.",democrat parti outrag shock revel almost presidenti elect resum controversi investig hillari clinton declar juli matter close fierc donna brazil chairwoman democrat nation committe mani foul solemn oblig remain neutral polit matter even faintest appear use agenc power influenc elect deepli troubl said john podesta clinton campaign chief also hint skulduggeri extraordinari would someth like day presidenti elect podesta said statement left unclear whether anyth remot investig thi well true letter notif congress jame comey director said know whether batch newli discov email bore relat previou claim clinton act illeg send privat email contain classifi inform secretari state comey said email appear pertin offici examin later statement admit know signific email said felt oblig investig make decis public even certain email came clinton privat server comey move either extrem naiv extrem cynic investig routin conduct behind close door onli decis prosecut taken base persuas evid inquiri made public suspect name respect ostens independ figur like director hand extraordinarili sensit moment amount overtli polit partisan sinc must assum comey fool must also assum knew less damn explan clumsili attempt save critic republican right denounc earlier investigatori effort case comey confidenti word relev congression oversight committe nobodi could subsequ accus would trigger firestorm imparti question time left whatev comey reason damag done clinton must weather storm novemb previous believ clear rough ride ugliest person vindict presidenti campaign modern histori frenet furiou final donald trump support quick wade speak campaign trail republican nomine reviv jibe clinton corrupt habitu liar typic hyperbol term said conduct biggest scandal sinc waterg usual trump risibl exagger undermin case genuin anger alarm express clinton surrog reflect fear attack hit home knowledg damag renew question honesti compet could potenti although trump face least qualifi host reason objection republican candid live memori clinton still ahead poll nation averag thi bald figur consid mislead battleground swing state elector colleg decid clinton ahead ohio iowa georgia poll across nation tighten thi latest flurri neg headlin nation media desper sensat stori keep race aliv case dish help despit advantag experi name recognit polit achiev spend power clinton evid fail knock trump race despit deepli damag week trump beset alleg sexual misconduct still appear amazingli shot skill savvi politician clinton could would buri trump month charismat popular likeabl democrat could await elector coron thi latest blow caus underwhelm democrat abstain clinton best pitch sceptic independ undecid voter least worst candid leav vulner upset
54,Fire at Sea review – masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis,"Gianfranco Rosi’s beautiful, mysterious and moving film is a documentary that looks like a neorealist classic. It is a portrait of Lampedusa, the Sicilian island where desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East arrive each year hoping for a new life in Europe: 400, 000 in the last 20 years. Around its coast thousands are drowned, or dragged dead from their grotesquely unsafe inflatables, burned or poisoned by fumes from the diesel with which their craft have had to be refuelled from jerry cans   in choppy seas. Lampedusa has quietly become the tragic epicentre of the migrant experience: part holding tank, part cemetery. The title refers to a wartime Sicilian song that a local DJ is shown playing, about the bombing of an Italian warship in 1943 in port at Lampedusa, prior to the island’s surrender to the allies, and how the flames lit up the night: Che fuoco a mare che c’è stasera (“What fire at sea there is tonight”). It also put me in mind of the line from the maritime hymn: “For those in peril on the sea. ” Islanders in Lampedusa make a living from fishing. Generations have grown up and grown old with the fear of dying at sea. The endless tide of migrants has made that fear a daily and horrible reality. Using mainly fixed camera positions and no narrative voiceover, Gianfranco Rosi enigmatically juxtaposes scenes, switching between the migrants’ daily, desperate landfall, and the everyday existence of one Lampedusa family: and one young boy in particular, Samuele, whose uncle is a fisherman. Samuele does his best at school, he slurps his pasta at dinner, and he likes cutting branches that will make handles for his naughty slingshots. He has a lazy eye that doctors are treating with the   method of blanking out one lens for the good eye, forcing the lazy one to work harder. Samuele is also suffering from hyperventilation and anxiety, and is seen by the same depressed doctor who has to attend to the migrants and carry out autopsies on their wretched corpses. He is the one explicit point of contact between the migrants’ story and Samuele, one hint of a symptom, or a larger malaise. Rosi’s previous film was the fascinating Sacro GRA, a   study of the Grande Raccordo Anulare, or ring road around Rome, and the people who live on this margin. There is a similar effect in Fire at Sea. Rosi has recorded quiet details from indigenous Lampedusan lives at the periphery of something far more historically dramatic and sensational, but the quietly telling details are like jetsam, flung out centrifugally. The film does not take a view it does not demand action. It simply shows us the details, and I felt I learned more from this film than from the nightly TV news. The migrants themselves pass through the film almost too quickly for individual lives to be registered, except one Nigerian who tells his story almost like a preacher or an actor: “The sea is not a place to pass by   …     The sea is not a road. ” This is daily life, the film is saying: maybe like life during wartime. It is not a temporary eruption or crisis that will be imminently solved within the conventional news cycle. Here is the rhythm of daily existence it is Lampedusa’s new normal. There is an enigmatic pageant of scenes: setting the table for supper, listening to the radio, opening the hangar door for the   rescue helicopter (a mesmerically slow and sinuous sequence) migrants having a football match in near darkness and arguing about which nationalities can play, migrants’ dead bodies taken ashore by coastguards in white hazmat suits. The islanders are not shown objecting to the migrants, or welcoming them, or discussing what to do about them. I concede that this is arguably a flaw, an artefactual silence that drains the situation of its political reality. But it shows that this is a situation that Lampedusa has become used to over decades. Samuele himself is a compelling figure. There is one very simple edit Rosi contrives, showing him taking aim with his catapult and then just cutting to his face in closeup, frowning with concentration: pugnacious, yet innocent and vulnerable. In its quiet way, it is sensational. I’m tempted to say Samuele is a descendant of Enzo Staiola as young Bruno in De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves. What does Samuele’s face mean? Has he somehow absorbed the spores of world history? Is his artless manner a way of suggesting that life will go on, with or without compassion or solutions?

55,Samantha Bee meets Glenn Beck: ’It’s all of us against Trumpism’,"Samantha Bee and Glenn Beck sat down to discuss the Trump tenure, with the former rightwing Fox host admitting he had made mistakes and that he didn’t want to do any more damage. On the latest episode of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the comedian and Beck talked through the changes they thought were needed in order to help Americans get through the next four years.  Top of the list was a thawing of the relationship between those on the left and right of the political discussion, who might actually both agree “Trumpism” could do serious damage to the country. When Beck asked why Bee had invited him on the show, she said: “Because I think that our future is going to require a broad coalition of nonpartisan decency. It’s not just individual people against Donald Trump, it’s all of us against Trumpism. And so I actually think it’s important to reach into places where we wouldn’t normally reach. ” Beck added that he was a fan of Bee’s and that he believed in her message and approach to tackling American politics. “I believe you actually don’t want to do damage,” he said. “As a guy who has done damage, I don’t want to do any more damage. I know what I did. I helped divide. My message to you is please don’t make the mistakes that I made. ” He went on to say that Facebook and Twitter had become places where people sought to find division and “tear each other apart”. Another segment highlighted the action being take in North Carolina by Republican politicians who are seeking to erode the powers of the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper.  Bee also focused on the Syrian crisis. With politicians such as Trump suggesting helping refugees would mean neglecting US veterans, Bee’s correspondent Allana Harkin interviewed veterans who disagreed.",samantha glenn beck discuss trump tenur former rightw host admit made mistak want damag latest episod full frontal samantha comedian beck talk chang thought need order help american next four year list thaw relationship left right polit discuss might actual agre trumpism could seriou damag countri when beck ask invit show said becaus think futur go requir broad coalit nonpartisan decenc individu peopl donald trump trumpism actual think import reach place normal reach beck ad believ messag approach tackl american polit believ actual want damag said done damag want damag know help divid messag pleas make mistak made went facebook twitter becom place peopl sought find divis tear apart anoth segment highlight action take north carolina republican politician seek erod power newli elect democrat governor cooper also focus syrian crisi with politician trump suggest help refuge would mean neglect veteran correspond allana harkin interview veteran disagre
56,SEC document shows Trump was worth less than half of $10bn claim in 2012,"On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump’s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.  A passage in the   filing says: “The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential,   and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4. 2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. ” The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, insisted the 2012 filing was correct.  She said: “Obviously, if it was inaccurate, we wouldn’t have filed it with the SEC. ” While $250m is a large amount of money, it is nowhere near enough to finance a modern presidential campaign. Trump has already loaned between $43m and $50m to his campaign, raising questions about how much he can afford to continue to spend without selling off assets or taking on significant loans.  Trump has insisted that he has far more than $250m in liquid assets, last year telling Fox News anchor Sean Hannity he had $400m, all of which he was prepared to use. In sworn testimony for a 2007 lawsuit, deposition transcripts show, Trump was asked by a lawyer whether he had “ever exaggerated in statements about your properties?” “I think everyone does,” Trump answered. The lawyer pressed: “Does that mean that sometimes you’ll inflate the value of your properties in your statements?” “Not beyond reason,” Trump said. Trump’s claim to be able to   his campaign has been a foundation of his   successful claim to be independent of the Washington establishment. Although he is now frantically building a fundraising apparatus, he has insisted this is simply to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise money for the party as a whole. His campaign reported only $1. 3m “cash on hand” to begin the month of June, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s $42. 5m. The RNC has not seemed overly concerned. Speaking to CNN in June, the group’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, said that if Trump “wanted to get that [fundraising] number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it’s up”. The Trump campaign has insisted that the businessman has converted his loan into a donation. No such paperwork has yet been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  The 2012 SEC filing contradicts a claim made by Trump in November 2011, in which he said he had a net worth of more than $7bn and insisted that he derived almost $3bn from the value of his personal brand. In May 2016, Trump filed a statement with the FEC in which he insisted his “net worth is in excess of $10bn”. The disclosure indicated that he had taken on at least $50m in debt and sold off assets in the past year. While the statement from Wells Fargo indicates that Trump may be far less wealthy than he claims, it would also indicate that he is in better financial shape than many financial experts believe, unless he has suffered significant undisclosed financial losses in recent years.  Fortune magazine has estimated that Trump is currently worth $3. 9bn in 2015, Bloomberg News assessed Trump’s fortune at $2. 9bn.  Another billionaire, Mark Cuban, has scoffed at Trump’s claims, suggesting the presumptive Republican nominee may not be a billionaire at all. Cuban’s reading of Trump’s most recent financial disclosure was that Trump may only have $165m available.",campaign trail donald trump insist worth howev statement file secur exchang commiss well fargo secur trump behalf indic real estat develop worth less half compar liquid asset financ campaign presid document concern securit commerci mortgag properti includ trump tower york citi trump describ worth liquid asset passag file say sponsor donald trump trump signific commerci real estat hold worldwid includ interest offic retail residenti hospit properti market includ york francisco florida washington scotland june trump report worth excess liquid excess trump campaign respond multipl request comment jessica spokeswoman well fargo insist file correct said obvious inaccur file while larg amount money nowher near enough financ modern presidenti campaign trump alreadi loan campaign rais question much afford continu spend without sell asset take signific loan trump insist liquid asset last year tell new anchor sean hanniti prepar sworn testimoni lawsuit deposit transcript show trump ask lawyer whether ever exagger statement properti think everyon trump answer lawyer press doe mean sometim inflat valu properti statement beyond reason trump said trump claim abl campaign foundat success claim independ washington establish although frantic build fundrais apparatu insist simpli help republican nation committe rais money parti whole campaign report cash hand begin month june contrast hillari clinton seem overli concern speak june group chief strategist sean spicer said trump want fundrais number second stroke check trump campaign insist businessman convert loan donat paperwork file feder elect commiss file contradict claim made trump novemb said worth insist deriv almost valu person brand trump file statement insist worth excess disclosur indic taken least debt sold asset past year while statement well fargo indic trump less wealthi claim would also indic better financi shape mani financi expert believ unless suffer signific undisclos financi loss recent year fortun magazin estim trump current worth bloomberg new assess trump fortun anoth billionair mark cuban scof trump claim suggest presumpt republican nomine billionair cuban read trump recent financi disclosur trump avail

58,Capybara captured: rodent’s brief taste of freedom comes to an end,"Toronto’s second     is back behind bars, after an   five weeks on the run from a Toronto park, munching grass and lolling around in ponds. The capybara’s brief taste of freedom came to an end on Tuesday, after the rodent  —   native to South America and resembling a large, tailless beaver with stumpy legs  —   was lured into a cage near a pond in the   park in the city.  “It’s baaaack!” Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation announced on Facebook. The capybara, it said, was now resting indoors as it awaited medical assessment. “Once it gets a clean bill of health, and is comfortable in its surroundings, it will be reunited with the other capybara. ” The announcement brought an end to Toronto’s saga of the missing capybaras  —   a tale that captured the city’s imagination and made headlines around the world. On 24 May, two capybaras, one male and one female, bolted from a small zoo in Toronto’s High Park. It was their first day at the High Park zoo, after being brought in from a breeder in Texas to join Chewie, the zoo’s lone capybara.  The door on their cage reportedly wasn’t properly closed and the pair, dubbed Bonnie and Clyde by zoo staff, fled. One of the capybaras was captured earlier this month, but the other remained at large for another two weeks, outmaneuvering search teams in hot pursuit.  As hundreds of Toronto residents reported sightings, officials warned residents not to approach the animals. The world’s largest rodent, capybaras can grow to weigh as much as 150lb. Just six months old, Toronto’s rogue capybaras are around 30lb in size.  The outlaws were celebrated as folk heroes on social media, with capybara Twitter accounts taunting the dozens of park employees and capybara hunters out searching for the fugitives: “We can hear helicopters overhead. Is that you looking for us, @HighParkZoo?” Volunteers and professionals joined the search, learning all they could about the sleeping and eating habits of the rodents in order to predict their next moves.  After initial attempts to attract the rodents by playing capybara calls over a speaker yielded no results, search teams turned to traps baited with corn and fruit to lure the animals. Ultimately this was how both of the wayward rodents were captured.  Officials said the second capybara could be back in its place at the zoo  —   and on display to the public  —   as early as Thursday.",toronto second back behind bar five week toronto park munch grass loll around pond capybara brief tast freedom came tuesday rodent nativ south america resembl larg tailless beaver stumpi leg lure cage near pond park citi baaaack toronto park forestri recreat announc facebook capybara said rest indoor await medic assess onc get clean bill health comfort surround reunit capybara announc brought toronto saga miss capybara tale captur citi imagin made headlin around world capybara male femal bolt small toronto high park first high park brought breeder texa join chewi lone capybara door cage reportedli properli close pair dub bonni clyde staff fled capybara captur earlier month remain larg anoth week outmaneuv search team pursuit hundr toronto resid report sight offici warn resid approach anim world largest rodent capybara grow weigh much just month toronto rogu capybara around size outlaw celebr folk hero social media capybara twitter account taunt dozen park employe capybara hunter search fugit hear helicopt overhead look highparkzoo volunt profession join search learn could sleep eat habit rodent order predict next move after initi attempt attract rodent play capybara call speaker yield result search team turn trap bait corn fruit lure anim ultim wayward rodent captur offici said second capybara could back place display public earli thursday
59,"Wreckage of Captain James Cook’s ship Endeavour found, researchers say","Researchers said they believe they have located the wreckage of the Endeavour, a ship sailed by the famous British explorer James Cook, which was sunk off the US during the revolutionary war. The ship was scuttled in 1778 leading up to the Battle of Rhode Island between American colonists and the British, and was as part of a blockade during the revolutionary war. It now appears to have been located by the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) at one of nine sites containing 13 ships. The ship, which Cook sailed in the Pacific Ocean, passed through a number of hands before eventually being renamed the Lord Sandwich and used in the revolutionary war blockade. RIMAP said it had pinpointed the wreckage at a site that included five other vessel, off the state of Rhode Island in Newport harbor. The association is launching a campaign to finance the construction of a storage facility to accommodate the objects that are likely to be found during excavation. During his famous   voyage, Cook helped map the   Pacific Ocean and took possession of Australia in the name of the Crown.",research said believ locat wreckag endeavour ship sail famou british explor jame cook sunk revolutionari ship scuttl lead battl rhode island american colonist british part blockad revolutionari appear locat rhode island marin archaeolog project rimap nine site contain ship ship cook sail pacif ocean pass number hand eventu renam lord sandwich use revolutionari blockad rimap said pinpoint wreckag site includ five vessel state rhode island newport harbor associ launch campaign financ construct storag facil accommod object like found excav dure famou voyag cook help pacif ocean took possess australia name crown
60,Fukushima: tsunami waves hit after 7.4 magnitude earthquake hits Japan,"Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings issued after a 7.  earthquake hit off the country’s east coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass. The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, prompted urgent warnings for people to leave   areas in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore. The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along the country’s   Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1. 4m (4. 6 feet) was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am. The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures, until all advisories were finally lifted nearly seven hours after the earthquake. There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a depth of 30 km (18. 6 miles) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In a statement, the agency said the earthquake was thought to be an aftershock of the 9.  event that devastated the same region in 2011. The region was also hit by a series of weaker quakes throughout Tuesday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had restored a cooling system at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant that briefly stopped after the quake, national broadcaster NHK reported. The car maker Nissan suspended work at its Fukushima factory, which was badly damaged by the 2011 disaster known as the Great East Japan Earthquake. A spokesman for the company told the Guardian all employees had been evacuated from the plant, which is in the city of Iwaki, and the factory was unlikely to return to operation on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighting officials in Iwaki in Fukushima said a fire broke out at a petrochemical complex and was later extinguished, NHK said. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is overseas for meetings, said the government would work with local governments to help any affected areas. “From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take proper emergency measures,” he said. Twelve people have suffered injuries, NHK reported, including an elderly woman in Fukushima prefecture who was said to have been hurt when a cupboard toppled over. The quake also shook other parts of Japan, including Tokyo. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. The devastating 11 March 2011 quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake in Japan on record. The massive tsunami it triggered caused world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. All nuclear plants on the coast threatened by the tsunami remain closed in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.  Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the   of the country.  Even when in shutdown nuclear plants need cooling systems operating to keep spent fuel cool.

61,Ageist and body-shaming Trump statue falls short as art and satire,"What has been seen, the saying goes, cannot be unseen, and for Indecline, a   “anarchist art collective” that was surely the point: on Thursday, the group installed five   effigies of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, in five cities across the US that left nothing to the imagination. If you have none yourself, the title helped you out. The Emperor Has No Balls, the group gleefully dubbed it,   duplicates of the naked Trump in New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Seattle and Los Angeles. Each lasted barely an hour before being removed, but in an era where viral   precludes the fact of actually being there, that was more than long enough. The thousands of naked Trump selfies pinging around the social mediasphere made avoiding the gruesome spectacle impossible. Naked Trump is a part of us now, a perpetual presence forever an   Google image search away.  So now, inevitably, we’re left with the fallout  —   to parse meaning from the gesture, to clear smoke from the explosion and look for the fire. There’s an easy defence here, of course, if you care to seat No Balls (I’ll use the abbreviated version, if I may) in the   tradition of ghastly political satire.  Depending on how far back you want to go, using images where words would be seen as too crass or literal (or actionable) is a   tradition that stretches back to the Renaissance. Da Vinci’s array of grotesque little heads, the hellish fantasy landscapes of Dutch masters Hieronymus Bosch or Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which they peopled with every manner of grotesquely distorted, hybrid creature, are   of conscious social critique through art, while Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel are embedded with cheeky   aimed at the ruling papal class. In Spain, Diego Velazquez, revered as he was as the official court painter of King Philip IV, was a sly subversive, mocking his masters as they imagined him capturing their glory. No Balls, of course, engages in no such subtleties, so let’s push aside the notion of it as art straight off. It’s more in the company of the evolving gutter press of   England, unique in Europe for having no censorship laws, where the penny press made its fortune on the ribald caricatures of the powerful. (One famous image, from 1740, of an outsize Prime Minister Robert Walpole bent over, trousers down, his giant buttocks gleaming, seems an historical confrere to Indecline’s action this week.)  Indeed, No Balls has little affinity with great political art, past or present. One of the most powerful critiques of American policy I’ve seen in recent years came from the American duo Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, who represented the US at the 2011 Venice Biennale. The duo  —   known, though not well  —   looked to represent the ardor of their times: using gymnastic routines performed atop an actual   tank, it conflated militarism and athletics, perhaps America’s   exports, within the bounds of sharp political satire (that its nonstop clanking echoed throughout the grounds of the gentle Giardini captured another American hallmark: loudness). So where, in the great pantheon of such things, does No Balls sit? Not very high, and for a variety of reasons. Even to take the measure of great caricature, which relies on grotesque hyperbole to prove a point, it falls, if you’ll pardon the pun, a little short. While it receives full marks for its nominal conceit  —   hubris, which Trump quite clearly has in no slight supply, has prompted many a leader to lionize themselves in sculptural form  —   the stunted member of Trump’s anatomy to which the sculpture means to draw our attention is its undoing.  Emasculation, one can fairly say, is the least notable of Trump’s many shortcomings. No balls? For what presidential candidate in recent memory could that be further from the truth? This is the man who pondered openly how shooting someone on Fifth Avenue might help him poll better. Whatever Trump’s anatomical shortfalls, this is clearly not one of them, and the piece weakens itself with a contradiction to pitch a sophomoric joke. (For what it’s worth, a recent mural of Trump’s nemesis, Hillary Clinton, appeared on a wall in Australia in much the same fashion the candidate was portrayed as busty,   and dripping $100 bills. The cash we can understand, but the body? Like Trump, the tasteless   is undone not by its lack of taste, but its lack of point.) Speaking of anatomy  —   mercifully, in a general sense this time  —   there’s an argument to be made that, for Trump, given his own lack of boundaries, none should apply. But No Balls crosses, perhaps unintentionally, into territory that serves to undermine whatever message it may mean to carry. The piece, with its slumpy, distended belly, withered buttocks and sagging pectorals, crosses callously into generalized ageism and   unlike the attempted caricaturization of Trump’s particular bits, this is no joke, but rather an expression of unmitigated contempt, and whatever else it does, it dissolves satirical intent in an instant.  There are some that may say, in an age of Kardashians, Jenners and Cyruses, that no such rules apply, but I don’t think so. Whomever one is talking about, shaming his or her physical self is worse than cruelty for its own sake (though it is that): it’s irrelevant.  The group has made clever interventions in the past  —   replacing the names of stars on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame with the names of black men killed by police was a tightly bundled critique of the media and society’s rabidly misplaced attentions  —   but here, intended satire gives way to blind hatred that obscures their intent. And there’s nothing funny about that.

62,Donald Trump forgives more than $50m in personal loans to campaign,"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign announced on Thursday that the presumptive Republican nominee had “fully extinguished” his loans to his presidential campaign. The Trump campaign announced the loans totaled more than $50m, although the Federal Election Commission (FEC) only lists $45, 703, 185 loaned by the candidate to the campaign. Although no documentation had been filed with the FEC online on Thursday afternoon, a Trump spokesperson told the Guardian: “My understanding is it is in process and will be completed today. ” In forgiving the loans, Trump sent a major signal to Republican donors who were worried that he would use campaign contributions to reimburse himself. So far, Trump has only raised $17m in individual contributions, many of which have come from small donors buying hats from his campaign.  In order to run a competitive campaign against Hillary Clinton in November, most observers agree Trump needs to ramp up fundraising significantly. He has held few fundraisers and only sent out his first fundraising email on Tuesday. In a fundraising email on Wednesday sent by Donald Trump Jr, the scion claimed that the campaign had raised $2m from that initial fundraising email. Trump has long boasted that he was   his campaign as a way to establish his bona fides as a candidate independent of Washington special interests. However, despite his claims that he is worth $10bn, outside experts have long looked skeptically at those assertions and many have raised questions about how much of his assets are actually liquid and easily available to be spent on the campaign. In his most recent campaign finance report, Trump had spent $1. 1m, nearly 20% of his overall spending in May, on businesses that he owned. This included more than $423, 000 on facility rental and catering at his Florida resort,    and another $350, 000 on travel air on Tag Air, the holding company that owns Trump’s jet.",donald trump presidenti campaign announc thursday presumpt republican nomine fulli extinguish loan presidenti campaign trump campaign announc loan total although feder elect commiss list loan candid campaign although document file onlin thursday afternoon trump spokesperson told guardian understand process complet today forgiv loan trump sent major signal republican donor worri would campaign contribut reimburs trump rais individu contribut mani come small donor buy hat campaign order competit campaign hillari clinton novemb observ agre trump need ramp fundrais significantli held fundrais sent first fundrais email tuesday fundrais email wednesday sent donald trump scion claim campaign rais initi fundrais email trump long boast campaign establish bona fide candid independ washington special interest howev despit claim worth outsid expert long look skeptic assert mani rais question much asset actual liquid easili avail spent campaign recent campaign financ report trump spent nearli overal spend busi own thi includ facil rental cater florida resort anoth travel hold compani own trump
63,Longtime matchmaker Joe Silva reportedly retiring after sale of UFC,"In a development that might significantly affect the Ultimate Fighting Championship going forward, the organization’s top matchmaker Joe Silva is reportedly retiring. MMAjunkie first reported the news on Wendesday night saying that Silva might leave the world’s leading mixed martial arts promotion by the end of the year. Silva maintains a    presence at the organization and is rarely interviewed, but his ability to assess fighters and pair them in intriguing matchups has been a big part of the UFC’s success. His role predates the tenures of president Dana White and outgoing owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took over the UFC and made it a   dollar industry. A big part of the reason the UFC has been able to rise is the ability of their management to find compelling fights and package them in glossy    productions. Since the UFC controls the fate of their fighters, they mostly dictate the bouts. The fighters generally accept the proposed fights or risk being dropped. The MMAjunkie story says Silva is leaving after earning a share of the UFC’s sale to   this summer. His timing might be fortuitous depending on how much interest Congress shows in trying to apply the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin is pushing to extend the 2000 boxing law to the UFC.  Among the Ali Act’s provisions are stipulations that promoters must open their books to fighters, can’t enter into   contracts with fighters and have to use independent rankings in putting together championship bouts. Application of the law could extend more power to the fighters, but it might also hamper the UFC’s ability to put together the most attractive bouts.

64,Ian Traynor obituary,"Ian Traynor, who has died aged 60 of cancer, was the Guardian’s Europe editor and one of the great journalists of the period following the end of the cold war. An outstanding linguist, Ian was a man of the European continent and a passionate believer in the cause of its union, on the basis of both his professional experience and personal essence. In a recent conversation, he and I wondered how we would have reacted to being told in 1991, in the ruins of Vukovar, the town in eastern Croatia devastated by Serbian forces  —   which Ian covered unforgettably  —   that within 25 years this place would be in the European Union, but Britain would be on its way out. In 2003, Ian was appointed Europe editor, based in Zagreb and later in Brussels, where, said his colleague Simon Tisdall: “His performance was truly outstanding. No other correspondent could surpass his understanding and contacts. ” My first proper meeting with Ian came soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the edifice of communism continued to collapse in Nicolae Ceauşescu’s Romania. It being Christmas, people tended not to want to go, apart from Ian, myself and our Hungarian deputy foreign editor, Nick Dallman. The time came for me to relieve Ian in Bucharest, so he might cover other parts of the country. Journalists were holed up in the plush Intercontinental hotel in the capital  —   apart from, typically, the Guardian, which Ian had headquartered in the cheaper, peeling Continental hotel, also home to a Securitate secret service sniper’s nest. I arrived off a night train into the weirdness of slushy Bucharest to find Ian sitting alone in the hotel bar smoking a cigarette. “Hi there,” he said in his laconic Scottish timbre, “welcome to Romania  —   it’s fucked, and there’s shooting from the hotel, which is returned the Washington Post guy left when a bullet hit his bedhead. Also, we have to file from a Bulgarian telex machine with several keys missing. The coffee’s good, would you like one?” Ian imparted this information deadpan the whole place was like a    newsreel movie from another time anyway, and had he not devoted his life to journalism, he would have made a magnificent actor. But that was never going to happen. Ian was born in Penilee,   Glasgow, the son of Tommy, a toolmaker, and his wife Phemie (Euphemia). When he was 12, the family moved to East Kilbride, south of the city, and Ian went to Holy Cross high school, Hamilton. As a boy, he read George Orwell and mapped out his life in accordance with an acquaintanceship with the writing of James Cameron: he knew exactly what he wanted to be  —   the foreign correspondent he became. By the age of 16, Ian was proficient enough in Russian and German to win a place at Glasgow University, from which he dropped out, later taking a place at Aberdeen, where he graduated in modern languages. His best friend there was the eventual BBC correspondent Angus Roxburgh, who remembers discovering, on a Russian faculty camp, that Ian played the guitar: “I was playing Joni Mitchell’s California, a very difficult bit, and Ian just joined in. He was better than me, and we’ve always kept playing together. He had a wonderful style, and loved Dick Gaughan, John Martyn and Bert Jansch. ” Ian joined the BBC monitoring unit at Caversham Park, near Reading, translating and analysing media information from the USSR  —   different work before the internet, which involved finding sources as well as understanding them. He was among the first to foresee the end of the cold war and, in 1987, Ian’s rare talent was spotted by the Guardian’s foreign editor, Martin Woollacott, who recruited him to the paper’s foreign subeditors’ desk. Woollacott soon dispatched his protege to cover the stories himself: the Solidarity strikes in Poland during 1988, then the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thereafter, as East Europe correspondent and editor, Ian sailed and navigated the currents and   of events across the continent. When the euphoria of reunified Europe crashed into the nightmare of   Ian was one of what became the “Guardian triangle” of reporters (usually two of us on the ground) with Maggie O’Kane and myself  —   later supplemented by Julian Borger. By the war’s end in 1995, Ian had based himself in Vienna, but now moved first to Bonn and then Berlin when it became Germany’s capital once again, with the title of Central Europe correspondent. From there, Ian guided his readers through the way in which the organism of a newly expanded EU evolved around the German powerhouse. In 1999, Ian moved to Moscow. He charted the rise of Vladimir Putin and, as so often, was first to ring the warning bells. However, writing in 2000 about Putin’s redrawing of the map of Russia, Ian could not resist observing, in apparently deadly earnest, that: “Mr Putin’s writ does not run in Bashkortostan. ” Ian wrote straight, however contorted the story, and lucidly. “He was the opposite of a sensationalist,” said Roxburgh. He could read a situation with uncanny sagacity his editor for many years, Paul Webster, recalled him as “a rare combination of intellectual and     hack. He was a very brave man but there was no trace of bravado  —   he felt it was his duty to provide testimony. ” Roxburgh remembered: “This figure arriving at our compound in Afghanistan, having walked across the Panjshir Valley for three days without food or water, on the verge of collapse  —   I made him a cup of sweet tea. He was tenacious, to put it mildly. ” Ian’s devotion to “the story” made him the most collegial reporter of all, as eager to help other people  —   including me on many occasions, even the opposition  —   write good narrative as to write it himself, a rare quality. Tisdall recalled him as “a slightly   figure, not given to   or   in a media world where willingness to blow one’s own trumpet became, increasingly, the principal measure of individual worth. Perhaps this is one reason why his work was not sufficiently recognised in terms of prizes and gongs. Another was his   intolerance of bullshit. ” The   press corps when we were in Bosnia had at its kernel an antagonism between Ian and a particular expert who would argue that intervention against the Bosnian Serbs would set the region ablaze. Ian disagreed, and when Nato began its tardy, limited air strikes in 1995, the Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, capitulated immediately. Ian, vindicated, leaned across a table and told his colleague: “If you’re gonna be a prophet, you got to get it right. ” On another occasion, his drollness surfaced when Ian and I were driving through yet another incinerated town, levelled into the dust of its own charred masonry, in horrified silence  —   until Ian leaned back in his seat, staring out, and said quietly: “What is it the Serbs have got against roofs?” Ian’s son, Paul, described his father as “a man of many words unless he wanted to be a man of few. If he didn’t need to say more than he had to, he wouldn’t. Personal back and forths after months of incommunicado would usually consist of ‘Arite, what’s up?’ ‘Nae bad’. Not that he didn’t want to talk, that was just his style. And he was fundamentally unaware of the sheer admiration that family, friends and most colleagues felt for him. ” Towards the end of Ian’s career came three severe blows to the European dream. First, there was the crisis that pitched radical Greece against a   which Ian saw as a “disaster for Athens and colossal failure for the EU”. Then, as his health began to fail, the arrival of what felt like the future of the planet on Europe’s doorstep in the form of refugees from Syria’s carnage and Africa’s climate crisis. Ian was furious at nation states disguising their own failures as that of the EU. Finally there was Brexit, though Ian was by then too ill for us to feel  —   or read  —   his disdain and disgust. Ian had met his first wife, Jean Forsyth, while they were both students at Aberdeen. They married in 1982, and had two sons, Paul and Martin. Jean was with Ian during his final days. Their union ended in divorce and in 2003 Ian married Ivanka Anicić, whom he met in Croatia. They had a son, Sean. Ivanka died in 2011, and Ian is survived by his three sons. • Ian Traynor, journalist, born 11 November 1955 died 27 August 2016",traynor die age cancer guardian europ editor great journalist period follow cold outstand linguist european contin passion believ caus union basi profession experi person essenc recent convers wonder would react told ruin vukovar town eastern croatia devast serbian forc cover unforgett within year place would european union britain would appoint europ editor base zagreb later brussel said colleagu simon tisdal perform truli outstand correspond could surpass understand contact first proper meet came soon fall berlin wall edific commun continu collaps nicola ceau escu romania christma peopl tend want apart hungarian deputi foreign editor nick dallman time came reliev bucharest might cover part countri journalist hole plush intercontinent hotel capit apart typic guardian headquart cheaper peel continent hotel also home securit secret servic sniper nest arriv night train weird slushi bucharest find sit alon hotel smoke cigarett said lacon scottish timbr welcom romania fuck shoot hotel return washington post left bullet bedhead also file bulgarian telex machin sever key miss coffe good would like impart inform deadpan whole place like newsreel movi anoth time anyway devot life journal would made magnific actor never go happen born penile glasgow tommi toolmak wife phemi euphemia when famili move east kilbrid south citi went holi cross high school hamilton read georg orwel map life accord acquaintanceship write jame cameron knew exactli want foreign correspond becam profici enough russian german place glasgow univers drop later take place aberdeen graduat modern languag best friend eventu correspond angu roxburgh rememb discov russian faculti camp play guitar play joni mitchel california difficult join better alway kept play togeth wonder style love dick gaughan john martyn bert jansch join monitor unit caversham park near read translat analys media inform ussr differ work internet involv find sourc well understand among first forese cold rare talent spot guardian foreign editor martin woollacott recruit paper foreign subeditor desk woollacott soon dispatch proteg cover stori solidar strike poland fall berlin wall thereaft east europ correspond editor sail navig current event across contin when euphoria reunifi europ crash nightmar becam guardian triangl report usual ground maggi kane later supplement julian borger base vienna move first bonn berlin becam germani capit titl central europ correspond from guid reader organ newli expand evolv around german powerhous move moscow chart rise vladimir putin often first ring warn bell howev write putin redraw russia could resist observ appar deadli earnest putin writ bashkortostan wrote straight howev contort stori lucidli opposit sensationalist said roxburgh could read situat uncanni sagac editor mani year paul webster recal rare combin intellectu hack brave trace bravado felt duti provid testimoni roxburgh rememb thi figur arriv compound afghanistan walk across panjshir valley three day without food water verg collaps made sweet tenaci mildli devot stori made collegi report eager help peopl includ mani occas even opposit write good narr write rare qualiti tisdal recal slightli figur given media world willing blow trumpet becam increasingli princip measur individu worth perhap reason work suffici recognis term prize gong anoth intoler bullshit press corp bosnia kernel antagon particular expert would argu intervent bosnian serb would region ablaz disagre nato began tardi limit strike serb leader radovan karad capitul immedi vindic lean across tabl told colleagu gonna prophet right anoth occas droll surfac drive anoth inciner town level dust char masonri horrifi silenc lean back seat stare said quietli what serb roof paul describ father mani word unless want need person back forth month incommunicado would usual consist arit want talk style fundament unawar sheer admir famili friend colleagu felt toward career came three sever blow european dream first crisi pitch radic greec disast athen coloss failur then health began fail arriv felt like futur planet europ doorstep form refuge syria carnag africa climat crisi furiou nation state disguis failur final brexit though feel read disdain disgust first wife jean forsyth student aberdeen they marri son paul martin jean final day their union end divorc marri ivanka anici croatia they sean ivanka die surviv three son traynor journalist born novemb die august
65,’The end of Trump’: how Facebook deepens millennials’ confirmation bias,"HBO host John Oliver achieved the destruction of Donald Trump on 29 February 2016. At least, according to the Daily Beast. Fansided, a popular social news aggregator, dates Trump’s destruction at 1 August while the Daily Good called it for 21 March. Salon found no fewer than “13 glorious times” that Oliver had destroyed the real estate tycoon.   consumers of the news might note that it is impossible to, as the dictionary says, “put an end to the existence of something” more than a single time. But for #NeverTrump Facebook users who love any content they see as bringing Trump down a peg, the formulaic headline is indicative of the Facebook media landscape: the most shareable, clickable and likable content on the site aligns strongly with its readership’s   biases, assumptions and political affiliation. For millennials who have never known an election without Facebook, the political landscape of the social media network has massive implications for the upcoming contest between Hillary Clinton and Trump  —   not least of which because of Facebook’s outsized influence on their exposure to political news. Six out of every 10 millennials (61%) get their political news on Facebook, according to a survey conducted by Pew Research Center, making the 1. 7   social behemoth (which includes more than 200 million in the United States) the largest millennial marketplace for news and ideas in the world. But within Facebook’s ecosystem exists a warren of walled gardens, intellectual biomes created by users whose interest in interacting with opposing political views  —   and those who are them  —   is nearly nonexistent. “Baby boomers are the most likely to see political content on Facebook that supports their own views,” said Amy Mitchell, the director of journalism research at Pew Research Center. “  percent of baby boomers on Facebook who pay attention to political posts say the posts they see are mostly or always in line with their own views, higher than both Gen Xers and millennials. ” But baby boomers are the least likely to get their political news from Facebook  —   unlike millennials. According to another Pew Research Center survey from 2014, “consistent conservatives” were twice as likely as the average Facebook user to say that posts about politics on Facebook were “mostly or always” in line with their own views, and that four in 10 “consistent liberals” say they have blocked or unfriended someone over political disagreements. This creates what the New York Times’ Ross Douthat calls the “Samantha Bee Problem” named after the   comedian whose unbridled criticism of fellow   comedians for not holding Trump accountable for past statements sparked a “Samantha Bee Destroys   …    ”    of its own. The widespread sharing of Bee’s segment, Douthat hypothesizes, is indicative of political chambers that inured Facebook audiences to conversations solely with those who share their opinions. “Among millennials, especially,” Douthat argues, “there’s a growing constituency for whom rightwing ideas are so alien or triggering, leftwing orthodoxy so pervasive and unquestioned, that supporting a candidate like Hillary Clinton looks like a needless form of compromise. ” That confirmation bias  —   the psychological tendency for people to embrace new information as affirming their   beliefs and to ignore evidence that doesn’t  —   is seeing itself play out in new ways in the social ecosystem of Facebook. Unlike Twitter  —   or real life  —   where interaction with those who disagree with you on political matters is an inevitability, Facebook users can block, mute and unfriend any outlet or person that will not further bolster their current worldview. Even Facebook itself sees the segmentation of users along political lines on its site   and synchronizes it not only with the posts users see, but with the advertisements they’re shown. Test it out yourself: Go to facebook.   on your browser and click the “Lifestyle and Culture” tab under the “Interests” banner. You see the box titled “US Politics”? It’s followed with a parenthetical notation of your political alignment, from “Very Conservative” to “Very Liberal”. Platforms  —   and   websites  —   have followed the behavioral lead of Facebook’s users. “News sources”  —   largely aggregators of video clips and interviews from other sites  —   that barely exist beyond the sharing economy of Facebook have arisen as major players in the site’s political news sphere. Sites such as US Uncut, Occupy Democrats, Addicting Info, Make America Great and The Other 98% may barely have homepages, but their Facebook pages are rich with millions of followers and   engagement  —   in many cases higher than many mainstream news outlets combined. Occupy Democrats, a   page popular with supporters of onetime Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has 3. 8 million likes on its Facebook page. MSNBC, another   outlet with far wider reach outside of Facebook, has a mere 1. 6 million. Not everyone sees the proliferation of openly ideological outlets that meet the needs of openly ideological friend circles as evidence that millennials are more extreme in their confirmation bias than prior generations. “I don’t see sufficient evidence to buy the argument about siloing and confirmation bias,” Jeff Jarvis, a professor at the City University of New York’s graduate school of journalism said. “That is a presumption about the platforms  —   because we in media think we do this better. More important, such presumptions fundamentally insult young people. For too long, old media has assumed that young people don’t care about the world. ” Facebook is, after all, a reflection of its users’ wants and behavior  —   it’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault people seek out   news sources to buttress their political beliefs. Before Facebook’s walled gardens came the cable news wars between   MSNBC and   Fox News, and before that, local newspapers that catered to the certain wings of a city’s population. (Think the Washington Post versus the Washington Times.) “Newspapers, remember, came from the perspective of very few people: one editor, really,” Jarvis said. “Facebook comes with many perspectives and gives many as Zuckerberg points out, no two people on Earth see the same Facebook. ” The onus, then may be on millennials  —   and all Facebook users  —   to proactively seek out news sources outside of their ideological comfort zone. “Yes, Facebook shows us what our friends like,” Jarvis said. “But if you have smart friends, chances are they will send you to smart things. Further, arguments online show the existence of opposing views, so I don’t buy that young people are unaware of other sides. ” “Journalism’s job is to inform society. If society is   it is our failure. ”",host john oliv achiev destruct donald trump februari least accord daili beast fansid popular social news aggreg date trump destruct august daili good call march salon found fewer gloriou time oliv destroy real estat tycoon consum news might note imposs dictionari say exist someth singl time #nevertrump facebook user love content bring trump formula headlin indic facebook media landscap shareabl clickabl likabl content site align strongli readership bias assumpt polit affili millenni never known elect without facebook polit landscap social media network massiv implic upcom contest hillari clinton trump least facebook outsiz influenc exposur polit news everi millenni polit news facebook accord survey conduct research center make social behemoth includ million unit state largest millenni marketplac news idea world within facebook ecosystem exist warren wall garden intellectu biom creat user whose interest interact oppos polit view nearli nonexist babi boomer like polit content facebook support view said mitchel director journal research research center percent babi boomer facebook attent polit post post mostli alway line view higher xer millenni babi boomer least like polit news facebook unlik millenni accord anoth research center survey consist conserv twice like averag facebook user post polit facebook mostli alway line view four consist liber block unfriend someon polit disagr thi creat york time ross douthat call samantha problem name comedian whose unbridl critic fellow comedian hold trump account past statement spark samantha destroy widespread share segment douthat hypothes indic polit chamber inur facebook audienc convers sole share opinion among millenni especi douthat argu grow constitu rightw idea alien trigger leftw orthodoxi pervas unquest support candid like hillari clinton look like needless form compromis that confirm bia psycholog tendenc peopl embrac inform affirm belief ignor evid see play way social ecosystem facebook unlik twitter real life interact disagre polit matter inevit facebook user block mute unfriend outlet person bolster current worldview even facebook see segment user along polit line site synchron post user advertis shown test facebook browser click lifestyl cultur interest banner titl polit follow parenthet notat polit align veri conserv veri liber platform websit follow behavior lead facebook user new sourc larg aggreg video clip interview site bare exist beyond share economi facebook arisen major player site polit news sphere site uncut occupi democrat addict info make america great other bare homepag facebook page rich million follow engag mani case higher mani mainstream news outlet combin occupi democrat page popular support onetim democrat presidenti candid berni sander million like facebook page msnbc anoth outlet wider reach outsid facebook mere million everyon see prolifer openli ideolog outlet meet need openli ideolog friend circl evid millenni extrem confirm bia prior gener suffici evid argument silo confirm bia jeff jarvi professor citi univers york graduat school journal said that presumpt platform media think better more import presumpt fundament insult young peopl long media assum young peopl care world facebook reflect user want behavior mark zuckerberg fault peopl seek news sourc buttress polit belief befor facebook wall garden came cabl news war msnbc new local newspap cater certain wing citi popul think washington post versu washington time newspap rememb came perspect peopl editor realli jarvi said facebook come mani perspect give mani zuckerberg point peopl earth facebook onu millenni facebook user proactiv seek news sourc outsid ideolog comfort zone facebook show friend like jarvi said smart friend chanc send smart thing further argument onlin show exist oppos view young peopl unawar side journal inform societi societi failur
66,Daily Mail lawsuit is a message from Trump: stay away from my family,"The lawsuit filed by the wife of Donald Trump against the Daily Mail is a message to the media from her husband “to stay away from my family, particularly Melania” his biographer has said. Lawyers for Melania Trump on Thursday filed suit for $150m in damages against the newspaper in Maryland state court. The wife of the Republican presidential nominee is also suing a blogger, Webster Tarpley, from the state in question. In a statement, Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, said: “These defendants made several statements about Mrs Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation [and] broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the US and the world  —   without any justification. “Their many lies include, among others, that Mrs Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she met her husband. Defendants’ actions are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs Trump that her damages are estimated at $150m. ” The suit was filed in Montgomery County, a suburban area bordering Washington DC, in response to articles published in August by the Daily Mail that reported rumors that Melania Trump worked as an escort in the 1990s. Last month, announcing that she was considering a suit, her lawyer called those rumors “100% false”. In an interview with the Guardian, biographer Wayne Barrett, who has been threatened with lawsuits by Trump in the past over his reporting, said that the lawsuit seemed to be “more a threat to other reporters, publishers, news organizations” to shy away from reporting about the Republican nominee’s wife.  The author of Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth and Trump: The Deals and the Downfall noted that the candidate had a reputation for litigiousness with reporters and said Trump had bragged to him nearly 40 years ago about “breaking reporters”. Barrett noted that, at the time, “there hadn’t been anything written negative about Donald”. Trump went on to sue author Tim O’Brien for reporting that the Republican nominee had exaggerated his wealth in what Barrett described as an “attempt to wreck O’Brien”. (The suit was dismissed.) Barrett added that Trump’s approach with the press had always been, “from the very beginning, to threaten, browbeat, seduce them”. The Daily Mail article also contained allegations that Melania Trump came to New York a year earlier than she has claimed, raising issues about her immigration status. Trump denied a story in Politico in which questions about her immigration status were first reported. The lawsuit noted that while the article in question had been removed from the Daily Mail’s website, the newspaper had yet to apologize or formally retract it. The Mail included a retraction of the story in its Friday UK print edition. “We did not intend to state or suggest that these allegations are true,” the newspaper said, “nor did we intend to state or suggest that Mrs Trump ever worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business’. ” It added that its article had included denials from a Trump spokesperson and the owner of the modelling agency in question, and said it regretted “any such misinterpretation”. The retraction was also posted online. “The Daily Mail newspaper and  . com have entirely separate editors and journalistic teams,” it added. “In so far as  . com published the same article it wholeheartedly also retracts the above and also regrets any such misinterpretation. ” Asked if the retraction would affect the suit, Harder replied: “It does not. ” Tarpley’s blogpost, which has been retracted, claimed, per the suit, that “it is widely known Melania was not a working model but rather a   escort” and that she had a “mental breakdown” after a plagiarism controversy over her speech to the Republican national convention in Cleveland in July. Harder is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker Media and forced its sale to Univision last month. That suit was funded by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump supporter. Steve Klepper, an appellate lawyer for the Baltimore law firm Kramon  Graham, said the inclusion of a blogger in the suit indicated legal maneuvering. He told the Guardian: “Any time you have a filing that adds a minor   defendant, it’s a flag that they were joined to prevent removal to federal court. And as we know, Donald Trump has not been having been the best luck in federal court recently. ” Klepper pointed to a Maryland defamation statute that might provide a basis for Melania Trump’s suit. It reads: “A single or married woman whose character or reputation for chastity is defamed by any person may maintain an action against that person. ” He added, however: “Montgomery County has possibly the   college education jury pool in the whole country and I cannot see how the jury pool would be good for [Melania Trump]. ” News of the lawsuit came 68 days before the election, on the day Donald Trump pledged to promote “patriotism” in schools and a day after he gave a hardline immigration policy speech, hours after striking conciliatory notes on the topic in a meeting with the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The Republican nominee, who has consistently trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls, has developed a combative relationship with the media, blacklisting a number of news outlets and pledging to pass stricter libel laws if elected. A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Guardian: “We do not have anything in addition to the Harder statement. ” The Daily Mail responded to a request for comment by pointing to its online and print retractions.",lawsuit file wife donald trump daili mail messag media husband stay away famili particularli melania biograph said lawyer melania trump thursday file suit damag newspap maryland state court wife republican presidenti nomine also su blogger webster tarpley state question statement trump lawyer charl harder said these defend made sever statement trump fals tremend damag person profession reput broadcast lie million peopl throughout world without justif their mani lie includ among other trump supposedli escort husband defend action egregi malici harm trump damag estim suit file montgomeri counti suburban area border washington respons articl publish august daili mail report rumor melania trump work escort last month announc consid suit lawyer call rumor fals interview guardian biograph wayn barrett threaten lawsuit trump past report said lawsuit seem threat report publish news organ away report republican nomine wife author trump greatest show earth trump deal downfal note candid reput litigi report said trump brag nearli year break report barrett note time anyth written neg donald trump went author brien report republican nomine exagger wealth barrett describ attempt wreck brien suit dismiss barrett ad trump approach press alway begin threaten browbeat seduc daili mail articl also contain alleg melania trump came york year earlier claim rais issu immigr statu trump deni stori politico question immigr statu first report lawsuit note articl question remov daili mail websit newspap apolog formal retract mail includ retract stori friday print edit intend state suggest alleg true newspap said intend state suggest trump ever work escort busi ad articl includ denial trump spokesperson owner model agenc question said regret misinterpret retract also post onlin daili mail newspap entir separ editor journalist team ad publish articl wholeheartedli also retract also regret misinterpret ask retract would affect suit harder repli tarpley blogpost retract claim suit wide known melania work model rather escort mental breakdown plagiar controversi speech republican nation convent cleveland juli harder best known repres hulk hogan lawsuit bankrupt gawker media forc sale univis last month that suit fund silicon valley billionair peter thiel vocal trump support steve klepper appel lawyer baltimor firm kramon graham said inclus blogger suit indic legal maneuv told guardian time file add minor defend flag join prevent remov feder court know donald trump best luck feder court recent klepper point maryland defam statut might provid basi melania trump suit read singl marri woman whose charact reput chastiti defam person maintain action person ad howev montgomeri counti possibl colleg educ juri pool whole countri cannot juri pool would good melania trump new lawsuit came day elect donald trump pledg promot patriot school gave hardlin immigr polici speech hour strike conciliatori note topic meet mexican presid enriqu nieto republican nomine consist trail hillari clinton poll develop comb relationship media blacklist number news outlet pledg pass stricter libel law elect trump campaign spokesperson told guardian anyth addit harder statement daili mail respond request comment point onlin print retract
67,Controversial British designer behind planned $150m New York sculpture,"A controversial British designer is behind an audacious $150m public art structure nicknamed the Stairway to Nowhere planned for a new   dollar commercial development on New York City’s west side. Thomas Heatherwick’s design of a giant,   collection of   staircases that will give the public fresh views of the city was unveiled in New York on Wednesday and is currently under construction in Italy. But the choice of Heatherwick for the project is likely to raise eyebrows in Britain, since he is the designer behind the planned Garden bridge over the Thames in London, which has stirred much controversy. Public funding of the bridge is under investigation, and an expert report has projected that, if built, it may rely on further money from the taxpayer to cover its running costs. However, the private company behind the New York project said on Thursday, that it was “not concerned that there will be cost overruns on a large scale” for the staircase piece, even though the cost has already doubled from the original estimate of $75m, according to the New York Times. Heatherwick’s new piece is officially called “Vessel” and will incorporate 2, 500 stairs in a bold,   structure standing within a new plaza with trees, paths and flowerbeds, surrounded by skyscrapers. The new landmark is intended to be a stunning spectacle of public art while also being entirely accessible to the public, including an elevator to the top, which is expected to be 15 storeys high. Vessel will be positioned close to the Hudson river on the west side of Manhattan in Hudson Yards, a   former industrial   where new office buildings and luxury apartment blocks are now springing up. Hudson Yards surrounds the uptown end of the enormously popular High Line park that was built on a disused elevated railway line and, since opening in 2009, has held a magnetic attraction for New Yorkers and tourists alike to the neglected area north of the trendy Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods. Renderings of Heatherwick’s Vessel were revealed by private US developer Related Companies and its founder, billionaire Stephen Ross, who is behind the Hudson Yards development and is backing the art project. London’s proposed Garden bridge, a pedestrian link to be planted with flowers and greenery and span the river from Temple to the South Bank, was proposed by Heatherwick and others and became a pet project of Boris Johnson when he was the London mayor. But it was announced in June that the National Audit Office is investigating the use of public funds to support the bridge project. And in July, a   consulting firm predicted that official estimates of future donations to allow the bridge to operate at a profit were overly optimistic and the business plan for the project was exceptionally weak. London mayor Sadiq Khan halted some of the existing spending on the project, ahead of a review. Heatherwick had previously attracted both acclaim and controversy for his Olympic flame at the 2012 games in London. The spectacular cauldron of copper petals that rose up to form a flaming flower at the climax of the opening ceremony was hailed as one of the most original in the history of the Olympics. But a New York design firm, Atopia, claimed that they had submitted a remarkably similar idea to games organisers years before, and sued in 2013. The organisers of the London Olympics settled out of court with Atopia in 2014, although there was no admission of liability and Heatherwick maintained that the design process was categorically that of he and his team “from start to finish”. • This article was amended on 19 September 2016 to clarify details relating to public funding of the Garden bridge.",controversi british design behind audaci public structur nicknam stairway nowher plan dollar commerci develop york citi west side thoma heatherwick design giant collect staircas give public fresh view citi unveil york wednesday current construct itali choic heatherwick project like rais eyebrow britain sinc design behind plan garden bridg thame london stir much controversi public fund bridg investig expert report project built reli money taxpay cover run cost howev privat compani behind york project said thursday concern cost overrun larg scale staircas piec even though cost alreadi doubl origin estim accord york time heatherwick piec offici call vessel incorpor stair bold structur stand within plaza tree path flowerb surround skyscrap landmark intend stun spectacl public also entir access public includ elev expect storey high vessel posit close hudson river west side manhattan hudson yard former industri offic build luxuri apart block spring hudson yard surround uptown enorm popular high line park built disus elev railway line sinc open held magnet attract yorker tourist alik neglect area north trendi meatpack district chelsea neighborhood render heatherwick vessel reveal privat develop relat compani founder billionair stephen ross behind hudson yard develop back project london propos garden bridg pedestrian link plant flower greeneri span river templ south bank propos heatherwick other becam project bori johnson london mayor announc june nation audit offic investig public fund support bridg project juli consult firm predict offici estim futur donat allow bridg oper profit overli optimist busi plan project except weak london mayor sadiq khan halt exist spend project ahead review heatherwick previous attract acclaim controversi olymp flame game london spectacular cauldron copper petal rose form flame flower climax open ceremoni hail origin histori olymp york design firm atopia claim submit remark similar idea game organis year su organis london olymp settl court atopia although admiss liabil heatherwick maintain design process categor team start finish thi articl amend septemb clarifi detail relat public fund garden bridg
68,Cuba offers to pay off debt to Czech Republic in rum,"  Cuba has offered to pay its old debt to the Czech Republic with goods it can spare, including its coveted rum, according to the Czech finance ministry. “The Cuban party as a possible solution presented a list of commodities   …     [including] several brands of rum,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday. Czech media put the Cuban debt at about 7bn koruna ($270m) but the ministry said it had yet to tally the total sum as talks on the repayment had only started late last year. The debt is largely the legacy of business ties between Cuba and Czechoslovakia, which split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, four years after shedding four decades of communist rule. The largest Czech broadsheet daily Dnes quoted the deputy finance minister, Lenka Dupakova, as saying debt repayment in Cuban rum was “an interesting option”. “These are relatively unknown brands which might be good, but we would have to advertise them and generally launch them into the market,” she added. The daily said the Czech Republic  —   a country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world  —   had imported 892 tonnes of Cuban rum worth 53m koruna ($2m) in 2015. If the entire debt were repaid in rum, the Czechs would have enough rum for 130 years at this pace. But the ministry is against such a solution. “The Czech side believes that at least part of the debt should be dealt in cash,” it said.",cuba offer debt czech republ good spare includ covet accord czech financ ministri cuban parti possibl solut present list commod includ sever brand ministri said statement friday czech media cuban debt koruna ministri said talli total talk repay start late last year debt larg legaci busi tie cuba czechoslovakia split czech republ slovakia four year shed four decad communist rule largest czech broadsheet daili dne quot deputi financ minist lenka dupakova say debt repay cuban interest option these rel unknown brand might good would advertis gener launch market ad daili said czech republ countri highest capita beer consumpt world import tonn cuban worth koruna entir debt repaid czech would enough year pace ministri solut czech side believ least part debt dealt cash said
69,Where will the out-of-control Chinese space station land?,"What is happening with the Chinese space station? The nation’s first prototype space station,   or “Heavenly Palace” launched into orbit in September 2011. The module reached the end of its service life earlier this year and was due to splashdown  —   eventually  —   in the Pacific Ocean. But at a recent press conference, the Chinese space agency admitted it had lost contact with the station. They did not explain what had gone wrong. Does losing contact matter? It depends what the Chinese planned to do next. If the agency was going to let the spacecraft simply fall to Earth in an uncontrolled way and burn up in the atmosphere, then the loss of contact means little. But if they had intended to perform a controlled   that option is now gone. Controlled   tend to be reserved for spacecraft that pose a potential risk to people when they fall back to Earth. If the chances of someone being injured by components that survive the fireball of   is greater than one in 10, 000, then the spacecraft should be actively steered into a region of the South Pacific known in the business as the “spacecraft graveyard”. The module is already below the altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) and so there is no risk of a collision on its way down. What was   for? Unlike the massive ISS, which is the size of a football field and has the living space of a   house,   is a mere 10 metres long and 3 metres wide. The Chinese used the module to practise rendezvous and docking procedures, and several taikonauts, including two women, spent time aboard after catching a ride on the Shenzhou spacecraft. Losing control of the module is more of an embarrassment to the Chinese space agency than a blow to their space programme. Two weeks ago, in a   launch, the Chinese put another space station module,   into orbit, and a crew of at least two taikonauts is expected to visit as early as next month. The agency still hopes to build a   space station by 2020. Will the stricken module survive  ? Satellite tracking radar show the Chinese module at 380km high and travelling at 27, 500km per hour. At that speed and altitude, it could lap the planet 5, 000 more times before it starts to feel the drag of the upper atmosphere and begin its final descent. Most of the 8.  module will burn up from aerodynamic heating in the Earth’s atmosphere. But the Chinese space agency has conceded that some   components may survive. “The module is predominantly a hollow shell, so there’s a good chance a significant portion will burn up in the atmosphere. But there’s also a chance some elements will survive down to surface,” said Hugh Lewis, a space debris expert at University of Southampton. Where will it come down? No one knows. And the vagaries of   mean it will be impossible to predict with accuracy, even in its final moments. Computer simulations cannot tell far in advance on which orbit a spacecraft will  . The   is moving fast, at a shallow angle relative to the atmosphere, and the height of the atmosphere at any point depends on the regional temperature. But even when an object has begun its descent through the atmosphere, the final resting place of debris is still hard to predict. How the spacecraft tumbles through the atmosphere has an influence on how it breaks up. The most space agencies can do is calculate a debris ellipse where fragments are expected to land. Are we in danger? Pieces of space debris fall to Earth every day, but most of these are small fragments. Now and again, whole satellites or rocket stages tumble out of orbit and break apart in the sky. The most dangerous uncontrolled   happened in 1979 when Nasa’s   Skylab space station came down over Australia. In 2001, when the Russian Mir space station had reached the end of its life, Roscosmos   the   outpost into the Pacific. But even with so much hardware raining from the skies, no one is known to have been hurt by falling space junk. “It is luck, but it proves that luck is on our side,” said Lewis. The odds are wildly in favour of not being hit because most of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, and most of the world’s population is crammed into a small percentage of land. The chances of a specific individual being struck by falling debris is trillions to one, making death by lightning far more likely.",what happen chines space station nation first prototyp space station heavenli palac launch orbit septemb modul reach servic life earlier year splashdown eventu pacif ocean recent press confer chines space agenc admit lost contact station they explain gone wrong doe lose contact matter depend chines plan next agenc go spacecraft simpli fall earth uncontrol burn atmospher loss contact mean littl intend perform control option gone control tend reserv spacecraft pose potenti risk peopl fall back earth chanc someon injur compon surviv firebal greater spacecraft activ steer region south pacif known busi spacecraft graveyard modul alreadi altitud intern space station risk collis what unlik massiv size footbal field live space hous mere metr long metr wide chines use modul practis rendezv dock procedur sever taikonaut includ women spent time aboard catch ride shenzhou spacecraft lose control modul embarrass chines space agenc blow space programm week launch chines anoth space station modul orbit crew least taikonaut expect visit earli next month agenc still hope build space station will stricken modul surviv satellit track radar show chines modul high travel hour speed altitud could planet time start feel drag upper atmospher begin final descent most modul burn aerodynam heat earth atmospher chines space agenc conced compon surviv modul predominantli hollow shell good chanc signific portion burn atmospher also chanc element surviv surfac said hugh lewi space debri expert univers southampton where come know vagari mean imposs predict accuraci even final moment comput simul cannot tell advanc orbit spacecraft move fast shallow angl rel atmospher height atmospher point depend region temperatur even object begun descent atmospher final rest place debri still hard predict spacecraft tumbl atmospher influenc break space agenc calcul debri ellips fragment expect land danger piec space debri fall earth everi small fragment whole satellit rocket stage tumbl orbit break apart danger uncontrol happen nasa skylab space station came australia russian space station reach life roscosmo outpost pacif even much hardwar rain sky known hurt fall space junk luck prove luck side said lewi odd wildli favour earth surfac cover water world popul cram small percentag land chanc specif individu struck fall debri trillion make death lightn like
70,Trump campaign doubles spending but staff is a tenth the size of Clinton’s,"Donald Trump’s campaign doubled its spending in July, even though the Republican nominee still only employed about 80 people, aired no television ads and maintained ties with his fired campaign manager and the writer who plagiarized part of his wife’s convention speech. His campaign lags far behind that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, whose team spent about twice as much as his did last month. Clinton also raised more funds, taking in $52m for her campaign and Democrats, according to July filings with the Federal Election Commission, while Trump raised $37m for his campaign and Republicans. Trump’s largest expenses in July were from a new push for online fundraising, as he moved away from donating to his own campaign and more actively solicited money from voters. Trump has given about $52m to his own campaign, but is no longer   the bulk of the effort through loans or donations. The campaign paid a   web design and marketing firm,   $8. 4m in July, about twice as much as it made over the last year. The firm’s president, Brad Parscale, is digital director for Trump’s campaign, and has worked for Trump’s real estate business since 2011.  Trump’s campaign also paid $20, 000 to the consulting firm of Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager he fired in June, two weeks after Lewandowski left the campaign and became a paid pundit on CNN. The sum was roughly equal to how much Trump’s campaign paid him as manager. The campaign also paid $356. 01 to Meredith McIver, an employee of the Trump Organization who took the blame for plagiarizing Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech for use in Melania Trump’s 2016 speech. McIver is listed as a   for several of Donald Trump’s books, and because of her work as an “ ” writer for Trump’s private business, the campaign risked violating campaign laws if it had not separately paid her. Though the financial documents show little sign that Trump has opened offices around swing states, Trump did show some signs of scaling up for the general election. He paid $100, 000 to Cambridge Analytics, a data analysis firm that formerly worked for Senator Ted Cruz and has ties to Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire who supports Trump. He also paid his Alabama state director, Chess Bedsole, $64, 000, three times his last payment, in December, even though Alabama has voted Republican for decades. The campaign paid about $2m for private jets and $500, 000 to pay for expenses on Trump’s personal plane. Last month, Trump paid more than $773, 000 to companies he owns since the beginning of the race, his campaign has paid more than $7. 5m to Trump companies or those owned by family members. In all, his campaign spent $18. 5m in July, including $1. 8m on hats and merchandise. Clinton, in contrast, reported 703 staffers, $2m on travel and signs of new offices. In July, her campaign spent a total of $38m, filings show, mostly on advertising. Last week, Trump spent $4. 8m on his first general election ads, which aired in four swing states. Trump’s personal finances remain mostly opaque, since the candidate has refused to release his tax returns  —   breaking 40 years of precedent by presidential nominees  —   and because his business is structured in a labyrinth of holdings, third parties and debt. A New York Times investigation into Trump’s finances found he had at least $650m in debt, far more than he disclosed on earlier FEC forms. Trump has said he will not release his returns while they are under an IRS audit, though no law prohibits that release. Clinton has released several years of tax returns, including from 2015, when she and her husband made nearly $11m. But she has been haunted by the web of donors, including foreign governments, that give to the family’s sprawling Clinton Foundation. The philanthropic organization has said it will no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected president, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to say that it would stop taking those donations during the campaign. Political action committees allied with Democrats were boosted by several billionaires, filings also show. George Soros gave $1. 5m to a Planned Parenthood Super Pac and $500, 000 to the Senate Majority Pac, and Tom Steyer gave $7m to his own Super Pac, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. Michael Bloomberg gave $5m to his own group, called Independence USA, and though the former New York mayor has endorsed Clinton, his Pac is also working to help Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, because of his support for gun control measures. Conservative billionaires have largely shied from donating to Trump’s campaign, and filings showed that Paul Singer and Charles and David Koch are concentrating on groups to support Senate and House candidates. Mercer, on the other hand, has given $2m to a   Super Pac, and also funds Breitbart News, whose boss, Stephen Bannon, took control of Trump’s presidential campaign last week.",donald trump campaign doubl spend juli even though republican nomine still employ peopl air televis maintain tie fire campaign manag writer plagiar part wife convent speech campaign lag behind democrat rival hillari clinton whose team spent twice much last month clinton also rais fund take campaign democrat accord juli file feder elect commiss trump rais campaign republican trump largest expens juli push onlin fundrais move away donat campaign activ solicit money voter trump given campaign longer bulk effort loan donat campaign paid design market firm juli twice much made last year firm presid brad parscal digit director trump campaign work trump real estat busi sinc trump campaign also paid consult firm corey lewandowski campaign manag fire june week lewandowski left campaign becam paid pundit roughli equal much trump campaign paid manag campaign also paid meredith mciver employe trump organ took blame plagiar michel obama convent speech melania trump speech mciver list sever donald trump book work writer trump privat busi campaign risk violat campaign law separ paid though financi document show littl sign trump open offic around swing state trump show sign scale gener elect paid cambridg analyt data analysi firm formerli work senat cruz tie robert mercer hedg fund billionair support trump also paid alabama state director chess bedsol three time last payment decemb even though alabama vote republican decad campaign paid privat jet expens trump person plane last month trump paid compani own sinc begin race campaign paid trump compani own famili member campaign spent juli includ hat merchandis clinton contrast report staffer travel sign offic juli campaign spent total file show mostli advertis last week trump spent first gener elect air four swing state trump person financ remain mostli opaqu sinc candid refus releas return break year preced presidenti nomine busi structur labyrinth hold third parti debt york time investig trump financ found least debt disclos earlier form trump said releas return audit though prohibit releas clinton releas sever year return includ husband made nearli haunt donor includ foreign govern give famili sprawl clinton foundat philanthrop organ said longer accept foreign donat clinton elect presid campaign manag robbi mook refus would stop take donat campaign polit action committe alli democrat boost sever billionair file also show georg soro gave plan parenthood super senat major steyer gave super call nextgen climat action committe michael bloomberg gave group call independ though former york mayor endors clinton also work help pennsylvania republican senat toomey support control measur conserv billionair larg shi donat trump campaign file show paul singer charl david koch concentr group support senat hous candid mercer hand given super also fund breitbart new whose boss stephen bannon took control trump presidenti campaign last week
71,Unknown pleasures: why rappers like Danny Brown love Joy Division,"If rappers are the new rock stars perhaps it’s because so many of them seem to be cognizant of the old ones. On Tuesday, Danny Brown, one of rap’s most interesting voices, released his new album, Atrocity Exhibition, named after a Joy Division song (itself named after the book by JG Ballard). Brown has a longstanding relationship with the band. In a 2013 Guardian interview, he cited Ian Curtis as an influence, and the band have informed his music since 2011’s album XXX.  Brown told Rolling Stone that he named the album Atrocity Exhibition because he identified with Curtis’s pain in the song  —   the authenticity of which received terrible confirmation when the singer hanged himself in 1980, aged 23. “I just relate to that song a lot,” he said. “That song, [Ian Curtis is] pretty much talking about how he feels like he’s part of a freak show almost. People just wanna come see him and they just wanna see him be a certain type of way. I totally relate to that. ”  Though Joy Division and Danny Brown  —   or even   and rap  —   may seem to exist on opposite ends of the spectrum, there is definitely an emotional through line that links the two. The band’s influence has added a dark tint to the sounds and aesthetics of two generations of backpack and avant garde rappers. Tyler, the Creator, who once called Odd Future “the new Sex Pistols” rapped that he was a “  Ian Curtis” on Leather Head. Earl Sweatshirt played Decades on a keyboard during his interview last year. Memphis rapper Cities Aviv referred to Curtis’ death on his mixtape Black Pleasure. Lupe Fiasco paid tribute to Joy Division with his band Japanese Cartoon. Kanye West asked designer Peter Saville, who created Joy Division’s iconic record sleeves, to design his logo. Vince Staples has said that Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures inspired his debut album, Summertime 06. (They were all following in the footsteps of Grace Jones, who released a scarifying reggae cover of She’s Lost Control in 1980.) In an interview with RBMA, Staples touched on why so many rap artists respond to Joy Division. “BB King and Ian Curtis sing about the same things,” he said. “It’s all life. In   specifically, everything is sectioned off   …     Why are we still trying to limit ourselves?” Rappers attempting to push the boundaries of   have often attempted to incorporate kinds of music traditionally circumscribed by the genre. As for the lyrics, the themes of many Joy Division songs  —   failure, crisis, loss and depression  —   are as relatable to rappers as they are to anyone else. It goes without saying that Joy Division are far from the only white rock band to have inspired current rappers. OG Maco, whose breakout hit, U Guessed It, went viral in 2014, recently released an EP called Blvk Phil Collins, a nod to the Genesis frontman. Aesop Rock has long cited folk rockers the Mountain Goats and   John Darnielle as one of his primary inspirations for his densely packed lyrics. Lil B once released a song “featuring” Elliott Smith, while Mac Miller’s producer alter ego Larry Fisherman later covered Angeles. Rappers often see their own reflections in the most unlikely places. During his 2014 Lollapalooza set, Vic Mensa covered the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, invoking the band as a means to rile the crowd up. Azealia Banks has long been an Interpol fanatic. She covered Slow Hands early in her career, and later said it was a dream of hers to be in the band. Lil Uzi Vert, a rapper the Fader called the “first rock star of   rap” has been vocal about his Marilyn Manson fandom. “Listen here, at age 27 I will leave this Earth for this man right here,” Uzi said of Manson in a Nardwuar interview. “He’s the Pale Emperor. ” Some connections make more sense than others. It’s easy to trace Coldplay’s influence on Atlanta bubblegum pop rapper Lil Yachty (who once said his favorite album of   is Ghost Stories) whose sugary synth confections often evoke a strawberry swing. Of course rappers are inspiring rockers, too. Earlier this year, Young Thug wrote a song called Rocket Man (whose title later changed to Elton and again to Kanye West on his mixtape JEFFERY) as a tribute to Elton John. John, in turn, said he was a fan of Thug’s: “I heard a track on Beats 1 and I loved it so much. ” Iggy Pop also recently   the Atlanta rapper. With his flamboyance, rebelliousness and gender fluidity, in his own way, Young Thug carries on the legacies of both Iggy and Elton. The rappers and the punks and the glam rockers aren’t really all that different. As genres continue to blur and artists become increasingly harder to categorize, perhaps we should be less surprised that they often understand each other.",rapper rock star perhap mani seem cogniz one tuesday danni brown interest voic releas album atroc exhibit name divis song name book ballard brown longstand relationship band guardian interview cite curti influenc band inform music sinc album brown told roll stone name album atroc exhibit identifi curti pain song authent receiv terribl confirm singer hang age relat song said that song curti pretti much talk feel like part freak show almost peopl wanna come wanna certain type total relat though divis danni brown even seem exist opposit end spectrum definit emot line link band influenc ad dark tint sound aesthet gener backpack avant gard rapper tyler creator call futur pistol rap curti leather head earl sweatshirt play decad keyboard interview last year memphi rapper citi aviv refer curti death mixtap black pleasur lupe fiasco paid tribut divis band japanes cartoon kany west ask design peter savil creat divis icon record sleev design logo vinc stapl said divis unknown pleasur inspir debut album summertim they follow footstep grace jone releas scarifi regga cover lost control interview rbma stapl touch mani artist respond divis king curti sing thing said life specif everyth section still tri limit rapper attempt push boundari often attempt incorpor kind music tradit circumscrib genr lyric theme mani divis song failur crisi loss depress relat rapper anyon els goe without say divis white rock band inspir current rapper maco whose breakout guess went viral recent releas call blvk phil collin genesi frontman aesop rock long cite folk rocker mountain goat john darniel primari inspir dens pack lyric releas song featur elliott smith miller produc alter larri fisherman later cover angel rapper often reflect unlik place dure lollapalooza mensa cover white stripe seven nation armi invok band mean rile crowd azealia bank long interpol fanat cover slow hand earli career later said dream band vert rapper fader call first rock star vocal marilyn manson fandom listen leav earth right said manson nardwuar interview pale emperor some connect make sens other easi trace coldplay influenc atlanta bubblegum rapper yachti said favorit album ghost stori whose sugari synth confect often evok strawberri swing cours rapper inspir rocker earlier year young thug wrote song call rocket whose titl later chang elton kany west mixtap jefferi tribut elton john john turn said thug heard track beat love much iggi also recent atlanta rapper with flamboy rebelli gender fluiditi young thug carri legaci iggi elton rapper punk glam rocker realli differ genr continu blur artist becom increasingli harder categor perhap less surpris often understand
72,"Johnny Marr: ‘When the Smiths went to No 1, we were surviving off crisps, chocolate and Coca-Cola’","I’m extremely  . I believe cucumbers are demonic, the black hole of the food world, infusing everything close by with their evil  . I didn’t actually try cucumber until 18 and I avoided them since. Which became more difficult after going vegetarian and even more difficult after going vegan. My first memories are of being   with food. I couldn’t stand cabbage, onions, courgettes especially. Dad would be starving for Irish stew after laying pipes all day, so it was all about him getting his food. I’d often hide food on my plate and just try to get meals over with as quickly as possible. Memories of being confronted by lunches at Sacred Heart primary are traumatic for me. All I really cared about was music, clothes, booze, cigarettes and drugs  —   until I was 25. The closest I came to food shopping was using a shopping trolley to carry a Vox AC30 amp. When the Smiths went to No 1 we were still surviving off potatoes, crisps, chocolates and  . The second time I ever flew was to New York. After a night at CBGB we’d roll out of bed and go straight to the local diner and there we discovered hash browns and eggs over easy and orange juice. It was probably the healthiest food I’d eaten until that point and probably got me off E numbers briefly. From the minute we made Meat is Murder I never ate meat again. Of course not I couldn’t be hypocritical. It wasn’t much of a sacrifice, to be honest, as nutrition still meant nothing to me. If you look at photos from that time I’m   and seven stone. I still miss cheese, because I ate a lot before going vegan. To say it was to clean myself of drink or drugs is a bit reductive. I’m a different beast. I just like the idea of change. I’m a vegan who avoids desserts now, but if you see me in a year I might be eating vegan Victoria sponge cake. Because I’m naturally a   Mancunian guitar player, to find myself becoming a marathon runner was an unusual thing. But if Bob Marley could get up at the crack of dawn to go running, then I can. This morning I ran 15 miles. Some days I’ll just do 10, others 20. You just get up and do it. After a full marathon I’m craving the biggest, saltiest pizza ever invented.

73,The Fourth of July: how to celebrate in your 20s and 30s,"The Fourth of July used to be one of my favorite holidays, but the significance of the day has changed since the halcyon days of slip’n’slides and flat soda pop. When I was a kid, it was all fireworks and good cheer, plus the kind of pure, unadulterated patriotism that only the young  —   and blissfully unaware of our country’s international foreign policy  —   can tap into. As an irresponsible    I made the Fourth a bit of a   bacchanal of cheap hot dogs, lukewarm beer, and far more illicit fireworks purchased from Mexico. Now, all I can think about is how to keep my dog from freaking out over the constant popping sounds in our neighborhood, whether or not the people at my barbecue can see my bald spot, and how soon I can go home. My point is that getting old is awful.  With age comes political awareness, higher alcohol tolerance, and an earlier bedtime. But it’s possible to be a responsible, perpetually harried adult and still enjoy yourself this weekend. Here’s how. Fun: As a kid, the Fourth means indulging in carbonated beverages in unlimited quantities. I could drink an entire   bottle of Pepsi by myself if I really applied myself. The rest of my Fourth of July barbecue experience was running around, avoiding pools (I couldn’t swim, as you might know) and appreciating the rare opportunity to go   without my mother worrying I’d step on a nail and get tetanus. Patriotism: It’s easy to be a patriot when you’re a kid, especially in my case as my father was in the Air Force. He was sent to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf war, which meant we were even more patriotic than usual during that whole period. I was the proud owner of numerous Gulf war trading cards and at least one plastic Army tank toy. In short, I thought of America’s role in the world being similar to a game of Missile Command. Fireworks: My dad was really particular about safety with fireworks. We’d have to stay at least 15ft away from the explosion, and he always kept a bucket of water handy in case things got out of control. Every year he’d get those snakes that all kids hate. You light a black disc on fire and it expands into something that resembles rat excrement. If you get to hold the sparkler, you’re really doing well for yourself. Fun: In your 20s, the Fourth means getting blackout drunk and usually throwing up on someone’s backyard. The question isn’t so much what to drink, but how early to start? My evenings always ended the same way: eating leftover potato salad and watching Fight Club on DVD or bootleg torrents of Family Guy. I had horrible taste. The biggest difference in Fourth of July festivities in your 20s is that you don’t have a backyard any more. You probably have some crappy apartment or dorm that may or may not have a hardly luxurious patch of astroturf. Maybe you can dupe your one friend who has a rooftop to throw a party, but is it really the same? You’re older now, but not old enough to appreciate that you aren’t dead.  Patriotism: America’s a bummer, man. My 20s took place during the Bush years, so I was especially angsty about the United States. The Fourth became an ironic occasion for me and my filthy leftist friends. Who could wear the tackiest   outfit? Who could recite the entire monologue from Independence Day? Look at us, drinking Budweiser and smoking Marlboros. America, LOL! It was insufferable. Fireworks: Fireworks in your 20s are usually influenced by the amount of alcohol you’ve had beforehand. In my   I would routinely go to a party hosted by my friend Josh. He’d get really drunk and try to light a sparkler with his cigarette. Illegal fireworks became a bit like scoring drugs back then. You knew a guy who knew a guy who could get you a crate full of shit that could set your entire block on fire. Fun: Here’s the same conversation I anticipate having at every party I attend: “Do you have any IPAs? My wife loves IPAs. I brought rosé. It’s such a hot day. Doesn’t that sound refreshing? Where’s your bathroom? When’s your wedding again? October. Oh, the rosé? I just finished it. Well, good to see you again. Give your parents my best. I’m just going to wait outside for my Uber. Can I bum a cigarette? I’ll give you a dollar. ” Food becomes far more important when you’re a proper adult. There will be vegans at your party. There will be guests who are  . There might even be some pregnant women who demand pickles dipped in ranch dressing.  It’s polite to bring something to any party, but especially a Fourth of July barbecue. These are communal affairs, and you need to chip in. But what do you bring? Bearing in mind the unique restrictions that govern your fellow partygoers, you must bring something that’s edible for everyone: healthy, but not too healthy   but not veggie dogs or veggie burgers. Invariably, veggie dogs get eaten by   who then feel put upon by carnivores who steal their food. Best to not create that clear division.  I suggest apple pie.  The point is not to make yourself happy, it’s to satisfy a social obligation, so just purchase a thing that has a patriotic significance and can be consumed by just about everyone. Pro tip: get a   one and only tell the people who are  . That way, no one turns their nose up at it. Patriotism: By the time you hit 30, your country has let you down numerous times. No matter what side of the ideological spectrum you’re on, you will probably end up finding something to complain about: taxes being too high, taxes being too low, the damn Democrats, the shifty Republicans, the cost of medical care, the proliferation of guns, the lack of guns, the crummy US soccer team, and of course, whomever the president is. The United States to a person past the age of 30 is nothing more than a stuffy debt collector that also happens to be a huge prude. Fireworks: Fireworks? What fireworks? Who wants to put their kids in harm’s way like that? At most, maybe you can light them at least 15ft away from your house and keep a bucket of water on hand just in case things get out of control.",fourth juli use favorit holiday signific chang sinc halcyon day slip slide flat soda when firework good cheer plu kind pure unadulter patriot young bliss unawar countri intern foreign polici irrespons made fourth bacchan cheap dog lukewarm beer illicit firework purchas mexico think keep freak constant pop sound neighborhood whether peopl barbecu bald spot soon home point get aw with come polit awar higher alcohol toler earlier bedtim possibl respons perpetu harri adult still enjoy weekend here fourth mean indulg carbon beverag unlimit quantiti could drink entir bottl pepsi realli appli rest fourth juli barbecu experi run around avoid pool swim might know appreci rare opportun without mother worri step nail tetanu patriot easi patriot especi case father forc sent saudi arabia first gulf meant even patriot usual whole period proud owner numer gulf trade card least plastic armi tank short thought america role world similar game missil command firework realli particular safeti firework stay least away explos alway kept bucket water handi case thing control everi year snake kid hate light black disc fire expand someth resembl excrement hold sparkler realli well fourth mean get blackout drunk usual throw someon backyard question much drink earli start even alway end eat leftov potato salad watch fight club bootleg torrent famili horribl tast biggest differ fourth juli festiv backyard probabl crappi apart dorm hardli luxuri patch astroturf mayb dupe friend rooftop throw parti realli older enough appreci dead patriot america bummer took place bush year especi angsti unit state fourth becam iron occas filthi leftist friend could wear tackiest outfit could recit entir monologu independ look drink budweis smoke marlboro america insuffer firework firework usual influenc amount alcohol beforehand would routin parti host friend josh realli drunk light sparkler cigarett illeg firework becam like score drug back knew knew could crate full shit could entir block fire here convers anticip everi parti attend ipa wife love ipa brought doesn sound refresh where bathroom when wed octob finish well good give parent best go wait outsid uber cigarett give dollar food becom import proper adult there vegan parti there guest there might even pregnant women demand pickl dip ranch dress polit bring someth parti especi fourth juli barbecu these commun affair need chip bring bear mind uniqu restrict govern fellow partygo must bring someth edibl everyon healthi healthi veggi dog veggi burger invari veggi dog eaten feel upon carnivor steal food best creat clear divis suggest appl point make happi satisfi social oblig purchas thing patriot signific consum everyon tell peopl that turn nose patriot time countri numer time matter side ideolog spectrum probabl find someth complain tax high tax damn democrat shifti republican cost medic care prolifer gun lack gun crummi soccer team cours whomev presid unit state person past noth stuffi debt collector also happen huge prude firework firework what firework want kid harm like mayb light least away hous keep bucket water hand case thing control
74,Best albums of 2016: No 3 Blackstar by David Bowie,"To say that David Bowie’s final album was coloured by his death two days after its release, and the revelation that he recorded it beneath the terminal shadow of cancer, would be an understatement. It was flooded by it. Few albums have ever been subjected to so much exegesis so quickly. Was the central image, coming from the author of Starman and multiple ruminations on stardom, an act of  ? Were the lyrics of Lazarus (“Look up here, I’m in heaven”) not just a reference to the lead character in Bowie’s confounding stage musical, an alien trapped in a Manhattan purgatory between life and death, but a loaded farewell? And what about those allusions to Elvis, Aleister Crowley, cosmology and the villa of Ormen? What did it all mean? One thing is certain. Regardless of the circumstances or the   Blackstar ranks among Bowie’s very best albums. Blackstar is a   world. Despite drawing inspiration from recent albums by D’Angelo and Kendrick Lamar, and featuring percussion from LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy, it never strains to be    like his 90s albums Outside and Earthling. Nor does it reference Bowie’s past as blatantly as his 2013 comeback The Next Day. Instead, he struck out for the fringes, the dark corners, the shadowlands, looking for one last new way to be David Bowie  —   one final incandescent flare of creativity. Bowie was always a consummate collaborator who sought out great players to facilitate each transition. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin’s   jazz band, especially the extraordinary drummer Mark Guiliana, enabled him to go in several directions at once. The song Blackstar opens like a black mass, with an   of dread, fades into the gloaming,   as a torch song, twists into a funk chant and loops back to the first section with twice the power. It’s as commandingly ambitious a composition as Station to Station, the title track of the album with which Blackstar shares the most DNA. Like Station to Station, Blackstar is an inky labyrinth of human cruelty and frailty shot through with moments of grace and transcendence, and obsessed with different kinds of transformation. And it’s another record on which each song carves out its own unique space, with no room for repetitions or redundancies. Even Bowie’s voice never does the same thing twice. It’s haunted, wired, seductive, menacing, mischievous, kind: a final multifaceted performance from pop’s great actor.  There is panic and brutality in the surly nadsat paranoia of Girl Loves Me the murderous sexual jealousy of febrile drum’n’bass psychodrama Sue (Or in a Season of Crime) and the cackling vulgarity of ’Tis Pity She Was a Whore, a   fable of sex and violence. Then there are songs of liberation and transmogrification. On Lazarus, death becomes a kind of freedom. Dollar Days is an expat’s farewell to “the English evergreens” and a plea for more time. I Can’t Give Everything Away pivots on the title’s poignant double meaning: a refusal to explain himself and a reluctance to let go. The wistful harmonica nods to A New Career in a New Town from Low, while McCaslin’s saxophone, often an agent of chaos, becomes a means of elevation, sending the record spiraling into the sky, out of view. “I know something is very wrong,” Bowie sings on the final track, and indeed it was, but then he was always fascinated by lives wrenched out of joint. And long before he was ill, he was preoccupied with death: the looming darkness that makes the light so much brighter. In 2002, Interview magazine editor Ingrid Sischy asked Bowie what he felt the point of art was. “It’s a   dichotomy  —   of the lust for life against the finality of everything,” he replied. “It’s those two things raging against each other, you know? And that produces these moments that feel like real truth   …     That is the entire story, right there. That’s it. There’s no more to be said. ” Blackstar says it beautifully.",david bowi final album colour death day releas revel record beneath termin shadow cancer would understat flood album ever subject much exegesi quickli central imag come author starman multipl rumin stardom were lyric lazaru look heaven refer lead charact bowi confound stage music alien trap manhattan purgatori life death load farewel allus elvi aleist crowley cosmolog villa ormen what mean thing certain regardless circumst blackstar rank among bowi best album blackstar world despit draw inspir recent album angelo kendrick lamar featur percuss soundsystem jame murphi never strain like album outsid earthl refer bowi past blatantli comeback next instead struck fring dark corner shadowland look last david bowi final incandesc flare creativ bowi alway consumm collabor sought great player facilit transit saxophonist donni mccaslin jazz band especi extraordinari drummer mark guiliana enabl sever direct song blackstar open like black mass dread fade gloam torch song twist funk chant loop back first section twice power commandingli ambiti composit station station titl track album blackstar share like station station blackstar inki labyrinth human cruelti frailti shot moment grace transcend obsess differ kind transform anoth record song carv uniqu space room repetit redund even bowi voic never thing twice haunt wire seduct menac mischiev kind final multifacet perform great actor there panic brutal surli nadsat paranoia girl love murder sexual jealousi febril drum bass psychodrama season crime cackl vulgar piti whore fabl violenc then song liber transmogrif lazaru death becom kind freedom dollar day expat farewel english evergreen plea time give everyth away pivot titl poignant doubl mean refus explain reluct wist harmonica nod career town mccaslin saxophon often agent chao becom mean elev send record spiral view know someth wrong bowi sing final track inde alway fascin live wrench joint long preoccupi death loom dark make light much brighter interview magazin editor ingrid sischi ask bowi felt point dichotomi lust life final everyth repli thing rage know produc moment feel like real truth that entir stori right that there said blackstar say beauti
75,Temple Taggart: Donald Trump wants to ’silence his accusers’ with legal threats,"One of the women accusing Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior, Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, said on Friday she was ready to countersue the Republican presidential candidate if he carried out his promise to sue all of his accusers. Taggart, who has accused Trump of kissing her on the lips without consent, is one of 12 women who have come forward since the publication of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which the businessman boasted of kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump, who has denied all accusations against him, said last weekend he would sue all his accusers after the presidential election. Taggart, who has hired the lawyer Gloria Allred, said on Friday: “I’m not afraid of you, Mr Trump. If you carry out your threat to sue me, I will defend myself. ” Speaking alongside Allred at a press conference in Utah, Taggart said: “I felt like Mr Trump was trying to silence all of his accusers who had come forward, as well as others who might be thinking of coming forward. “Enough is enough. I feel like he is trying to bully and frighten us into silence. Mr Trump, that is not going to work with me. ” Another of the 12 women who have accused Trump, Jill Harth, said on Monday she would countersue if Trump pursued legal action against her. Taggart first spoke of Trump’s alleged actions in May, telling the New York Times he kissed her twice on the mouth in 1997, when she was a    contestant in the Miss USA pageant. The first instance allegedly took place when she first met the businessman, at a pageant rehearsal. “Mr Trump greeted me with a hug and a kiss on my lips,” Taggart, who said she had been very naive and “21 going on 16” said on Friday. “I was shocked because that was the first time that any man had ever greeted me in that manner, but I ended up excusing his behavior as a way that east coast people meet each other. ” She said the second alleged incident took place when she travelled to New York later that year, to discuss her future with Trump and to meet modeling agencies. “To my surprise, Trump embraced me and kissed me on the lips for a second time,” she said. “It was that second kiss that made me wonder what his intentions really were. “What he did made me feel so uncomfortable that I ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again. ” Taggart, a Republican who says she will probably vote for the independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin, said she wanted to make sure that other women feel comfortable coming forward and not frightened that Trump will call them “liars” and threaten legal action. “Times have changed,” said the mother of three. “Women are empowered now. And we will not tolerate being bullied any more. ” Allred represents four women who allege inappropriate sexual behavior by the Republican nominee. “Groping women is completely unacceptable,” she said. “Threatening women who come forward to speak out about what they claim happened to them is also completely unacceptable. “I assure you, Mr Trump, they will not be left to stand alone while you attempt to trample over them with your lawsuits. Many attorneys will come to their aid. And I will be one of them. ” Allred has a history of representing women in sexual harassment and misconduct cases, including 33 women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual misconduct.",women accus donald trump inappropri sexual behavior templ taggart former miss utah said friday readi countersu republican presidenti candid carri promis accus taggart accus trump kiss lip without consent women come forward sinc public access hollywood tape businessman boast kiss grope women without consent trump deni accus said last weekend would accus presidenti elect taggart hire lawyer gloria allr said friday afraid trump carri threat defend speak alongsid allr press confer utah taggart said felt like trump tri silenc accus come forward well other might think come forward enough enough feel like tri bulli frighten silenc trump go work anoth women accus trump jill harth said monday would countersu trump pursu legal action taggart first spoke trump alleg action tell york time kiss twice mouth contest miss pageant first instanc allegedli took place first businessman pageant rehears trump greet kiss lip taggart said naiv go said friday shock first time ever greet manner end excus behavior east coast peopl meet said second alleg incid took place travel york later year discuss futur trump meet model agenc surpris trump embrac kiss lip second time said second kiss made wonder intent realli what made feel uncomfort end cut trip short bought plane ticket flew home never spoke taggart republican say probabl vote independ conserv candid evan mcmullin said want make sure women feel comfort come forward frighten trump call liar threaten legal action time chang said mother three women empow toler bulli allr repres four women alleg inappropri sexual behavior republican nomine grope women complet unaccept said threaten women come forward speak claim happen also complet unaccept assur trump left stand alon attempt trampl lawsuit mani attorney come allr histori repres women sexual harass misconduct case includ women accus comedian bill cosbi sexual misconduct

Now Zelda Fitzgerald, the southern belle turned   heroine, dubbed “the first American flapper” by her husband and    Scott, is to have her own Hollywood    —   two films are in the pipeline and a television series will air on Amazon Prime early next year. All three projects have starry names attached: Jennifer Lawrence will take the lead in Zelda, a biopic directed by Ron Howard and based on Nancy Milford’s   biography Scarlett Johansson will bob her hair for The Beautiful and The Damned and Christina Ricci will play the young and impetuous Zelda in the Amazon series Z: The Beginning of Everything. The title of the TV series comes from Scott’s awestruck comment on meeting Zelda: “I love her, and that’s the beginning and end of everything. ” So what is it about Zelda that fascinates almost 70 years after her tragic end? In part it is that the upheavals the couple lived through find an echo in our own tumultuous times. “Interest in the Fitzgeralds has definitely been on the increase  —   not only since Baz Luhrmann’s film of The Great Gatsby in 2013 but also from the many parallels between their lives and work and the period we’re living through right now,” says Sarah Churchwell, author of the critically acclaimed Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and The Invention of the Great Gatsby. “It’s a story of boom and bust and it resonates as we are grappling with our own boom and bust, our own worries about the cost of our excesses and our own social failures. The lives and fortunes of Scott and Zelda peculiarly mimicked their eras: in the 1920s they were roaring for all they were worth, but with the crash in 1929, everything fell apart. ” It helps, too, that Zelda was so vibrant a figure. “It begins with her beauty,” says Churchwell. “But also with the stories told in the 1920s about the high jinks and fun she and Scott seemed to have. People really liked her: she was surprising, intelligent, shrewd, funny and loved a good party. She also liked to be the centre of attention, and so had her detractors too. These things combined to make her a legend. ” Scott repeatedly returned to their relationship in his fiction, most notably in his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, which details the heady early days of their marriage and his melancholy fourth, Tender Is The Night, in which the gilded dream has faded into a more tawdry reality. Zelda’s only novel, Save Me The Waltz, presented the relationship from her side. They were arguably America’s first celebrity pairing: a carefree golden couple who wrote their way into the spotlight, creating their own mythology of   days and   nights, only to linger too long once the light had started to dim. “Their recklessness makes the story exciting and dramatic,” says Churchwell. “But they paid a very high price. ” After a few giddy years, all the youthful promise crumbled away, leaving Scott a dazed and drunk jobbing hack in Hollywood and bringing Zelda to breakdown at the age of 30, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, now widely thought to be a bipolar disorder, and a life in and out of sanatoriums. “Her story is both fascinating and tragic,” says Therese Anne Fowler, on whose novel Z the Amazon series is based. “Here we have a woman whose talents and energy and intellect should have made her a brilliant success, who was determined to be an accomplished artist, writer and ballet dancer in an era where married women were supposed to be wives and mothers, period. Her devotion to Scott was, in many ways, her undoing [although] he was just as imprisoned as she was. Had they loved each other less, they might both have come to better ends. ” The idea of Zelda as a brilliant woman trapped by her time has gained traction in recent years, with a number of works   her through the prism of feminism  —   although it is not always the easiest of fits. As early as 1974, the couple’s daughter Scottie resisted such claims, writing that attempts to view her mother as a “classic ‘ ’ wife, whose efforts to express her nature were thwarted by a typically male chauvinist husband” were not accurate. Writing in the New Yorker in 2013, Molly Fischer agreed, noting: “Saving Zelda Fitzgerald is no easy proposition. ..[she] does not want to be anyone’s pet, and there’s something disconcerting about the literary readiness to domesticate her, to transform an exasperating woman into an appealing heroine. ” The new films may well further “Hollywoodise” Zelda, sanding away her rough edges and reinventing her as a relatable heroine for our modern times. The casting of Lawrence  —   so often described as “America’s Sweetheart”  —   in the Howard biopic is no accident. A report about the upcoming Johansson film in the Hollywood Reporter suggested it would draw on previously unreleased material to “indicate that her husband misappropriated his wife’s ideas as his own”. Mark Gill, president of Millennium Films, the production company behind The Beautiful and The Damned, agrees: “She was massively ahead of her time and she took a beating for it. He stole her ideas and put them in his books. The marriage was a codependency from hell with a   soundtrack. ” The film has, however, secured the   of the Fitzgerald estate. Fowler agrees that there is a growing tendency to apply our own concerns to Zelda. “We do anoint her as a kind of   heroine, even though she didn’t see herself as a feminist and didn’t fully succeed at anything,” she says. “But her original reputation is based on conventional paternalistic standards of what a woman, mother and wife ought to be and do. Her ambitions and her insistence on pursuing them were considered inappropriate and unhealthy after her psychotic break she was literally told that this insistence had created her ‘split mind’ and that the path to a cure lay in giving up all ambitions that didn’t conform to the paternalistic ideal. ” The backlash against this image is understandable given that popular opinion of Zelda was initially driven by Ernest Hemingway’s notoriously caustic descriptions in A Moveable Feast, published posthumously in 1964, in which he dismissed her as insane and blamed Scott’s growing dependence on drink on his wife. “Our perception has very much changed,” says Churchwell. “We have come to sympathise with her frustration, to recognise her gifts and to be more   about her choices. ” That said, she cautions against attempts to create a Team   Zelda divide, as is so often the case in famous literary partnerships. “It’s important to say that they always loved each other and wouldn’t have appreciated people taking sides  …     Fitzgerald wrote a few years before he died that it was a ‘moral imperative’ that their friends understood they were a couple, a unit and would stay that way, even if her illness meant they couldn’t live together. ” Churchwell is also scathing about attempts to suggest Zelda had a larger role in her husband’s work than previously presumed. “There are people who want to credit Zelda with Scott’s work, which is just silly and doesn’t do women any favours,” she says. “It’s not a   game: we can recognise both of them for who they were. “Zelda had many talents, but where writing was concerned she was probably too ill when she started to hone her gifts, and while it is true that Scott didn’t particularly want her to write  —   partly out of territoriality but partly because her doctors told him it was bad for her  —   it’s also true that her work isn’t in the same class as his  …    . Her individual sentences are often lovely, and she can create a mood and has clever turns of phrase but her works tend to be sketches rather than full stories. If they had made different choices, maybe she could have been an important writer, but the reality is that she wasn’t. ” Perhaps, then, the true key to Zelda’s continued pull on our imagination lies not in her work but in her modernity. “I don’t want to live  —   I want to love first and live incidentally,” she proclaimed and it is that vitality and greed for all of life’s experiences, both good and bad, that stretches down over the decades, allowing each generation to see something new. Z: The Beginning of Everything will air on Amazon Prime early next year, ‘I have rarely known a woman who expressed herself so delightfully and freshly: she had no   phrases on the one hand and no striving for effect on the other.’ Critic Edmund Wilson, ‘I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity and her flaming   and it’s these things I would believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn’t all that she should be.’ F Scott Fitzgerald, ‘I did not have a single feeling of inferiority, or shyness, or doubt, and no moral principles.’ ‘All I want is to be very young always and very irresponsible, and to feel that my life is my own to live and be happy and die in my own way to please myself.’ ‘Other people’s ideas of us are dependent largely on what they’ve hoped for.’",thought origin wild child parti girl die fire broke north carolina sanatorium patient zelda fitzgerald southern bell turn heroin dub first american flapper husband scott hollywood film

77,"Larry King got $225,000 to interview Ukraine PM, says politician","The TV host Larry King accepted $225, 000 (£173, 000) to interview Ukraine’s   prime minister, according to a politician investigating a “black ledger” detailing alleged secret payments to the US from Ukraine’s former ruling party. King flew to Kiev in November 2011 to interview Ukraine’s then prime minister Mykola Azarov. Azarov was a key figure in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Ukrainian prosecutors accuse of massive corruption. Weeks before the interview Yanukovych had jailed his main political opponent Yulia Tymoshenko. After the interview King lavished praise on Azarov, describing him in flattering terms as a “straightforward and honest person with a deep knowledge of world affairs”. Speaking to journalists in Kiev at the time, King said: “After the interview I told my wife that he [Azarov] would have been a successful US politician. As for who he reminded me, he’s a bit like Jimmy Carter. He looks good, and it’s easy to meet with him. ” During the encounter King asked Azarov a series of softball questions, including: “What do you like most about your job?” “Why are you interested in politics?” and “How’s your health?” He mentioned Tymoshenko just once, asking Azarov: “Do you have any sympathy for her?” The latter replied: “Of course. ”  On Friday Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian MP and investigative journalist, presented fresh details from a “black ledger” belonging to Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. It includes records of $12. 7m in payments allegedly designated for Paul Manafort, then Yanukovych’s chief consultant and election strategist and who on Friday resigned as Donald Trump’s campaign manager. Leshchenko said the records documented a $225, 000 payment earmarked for King in return for the Azarov interview, which was broadcast by Ukraine’s   national TV station. “Money from the Party of Regions’ shadow assets was paid to Larry King. He received $225, 000 from the party’s shadow coffer,” the MP said, adding that the party had not paid taxes on its undercover slush fund.  King, who left CNN in 2010 and has gone on to work for Russia Today, was not immediately available for comment. Manafort has dismissed claims he received “black ledger” cash payments as “unfounded, silly and nonsensical”. Sources close to Manafort said he was not involved in flying King to Kiev. Rather, it was Azarov’s own press team that came up with the “stupid idea” and arranged the trip, they suggested. But the alleged Larry King payment appears part of a wider strategy by the then ruling Party of Regions to influence US opinion and to deflect criticism of Yanukovych’s increasingly authoritarian behaviour. The Associated Press reported on Thursday that Manafort’s firm had run a covert Washington lobbying operation. Its goal was to win positive press coverage in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and to undercut public sympathy for the jailed Tymoshenko. At the time the EU and Obama administration were calling for her to be freed. Between 2012 and 2014 Manafort’s colleague Rick Gates directed two Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group, to set up meetings between senators and Ukrainian government officials, the AP said. The firms were paid $2. 2m via a   “thinktank” the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The “black ledger” was found in the Party of Regions office in 2014, shortly after Yanukovych and Azarov escaped to Russia following mass   protests. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse Yanukovych of being behind the shooting of 100 demonstrators and stealing $100bn. An international arrest warrant is outstanding against Azarov.  On Friday, Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko’s parliamentary faction, said interrogating Manafort may shed light on the alleged secret payments.  “Manafort didn’t work for free in Ukraine. He served the Party of Regions for over 10 years. It’s clear that his work was paid,” Leshchenko said. “The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents,” he said.  This week Ukraine’s National   bureau published 19 pages from the ledger. They showed 22 items designated for Manafort, with payments ranging from $3, 468, 693 for “Paul Manafort contract” to $6, 000 for “Manafort expenses”. Other entries were for exit polls, research, and computers. In an article for the Guardian Leshchenko writes: “  ‘shadow accounting’ documents I have seen show $400, 000 in cash payments were made to him, which were intended to be spent on conducting exit polls. The documents show a further $812, 000 to be paid to him for engaging international observers. ”  “Ukrainians are concerned about the theft of public money. We want the chain of corruption to end. That is why many are troubled that Manafort’s name has emerged in this probe. ” He adds: “Manafort worked with Yanukovych  —   one of the most notorious European politicians  —   for nearly 10 years. This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such   cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?” The ledgers also suggest that Yanukovych’s Party of Regions was giving clandestine funding to the     Ukrainian party Svoboda, Leshchenko said on Friday. The payments were allegedly routed via one of Yanukovych’s MPs, Vitaly Kalyuzhny.",host larri king accept interview ukrain prime minist accord politician investig black ledger detail alleg secret payment ukrain former rule parti king flew kiev novemb interview ukrain prime minist mykola azarov azarov figur govern presid viktor yanukovych ukrainian prosecutor accus massiv corrupt week interview yanukovych jail main polit oppon yulia tymoshenko after interview king lavish prais azarov describ flatter term straightforward honest person deep knowledg world affair speak journalist kiev time king said after interview told wife azarov would success politician remind like jimmi carter look good easi meet dure encount king ask azarov seri softbal question includ what like interest polit health mention tymoshenko ask azarov sympathi latter repli cours friday serhiy leshchenko ukrainian investig journalist present fresh detail black ledger belong yanukovych parti region includ record payment allegedli design paul manafort yanukovych chief consult elect strategist friday resign donald trump campaign manag leshchenko said record document payment earmark king return azarov interview broadcast ukrain nation station money parti region shadow asset paid larri king receiv parti shadow coffer said ad parti paid tax undercov slush fund king left gone work russia today immedi avail comment manafort dismiss claim receiv black ledger cash payment unfound silli nonsens sourc close manafort said involv fli king kiev rather azarov press team came stupid idea arrang trip suggest alleg larri king payment appear part wider strategi rule parti region influenc opinion deflect critic yanukovych increasingli authoritarian behaviour associ press report thursday manafort firm covert washington lobbi oper goal posit press coverag york time wall street journal undercut public sympathi jail tymoshenko time obama administr call freed between manafort colleagu rick gate direct washington lobbi firm mercuri podesta group meet senat ukrainian govern offici said firm paid thinktank european centr modern ukrain black ledger found parti region offic shortli yanukovych azarov escap russia follow mass protest ukrainian prosecutor accus yanukovych behind shoot demonstr steal intern arrest warrant outstand azarov friday leshchenko member presid petro poroshenko parliamentari faction said interrog manafort shed light alleg secret payment manafort work free ukrain serv parti region year clear work paid leshchenko said money transfer cash imposs trace transact doubt authent document said thi week ukrain nation bureau publish page ledger they show item design manafort payment rang paul manafort contract manafort expens other entri exit poll research comput articl guardian leshchenko write shadow account document seen show cash payment made intend spent conduct exit poll document show paid engag intern observ ukrainian concern theft public money want chain corrupt that mani troubl manafort name emerg probe add manafort work yanukovych notori european politician nearli year thi casual relationship client perform such cooper incorpor gener worldview valu voter america valu want countri ledger also suggest yanukovych parti region give clandestin fund ukrainian parti svoboda leshchenko said friday payment allegedli rout yanukovych vitali kalyuzhni
78,In praise of one-hit wonders,"Dead Poets Society, that carpe diem bellow about a group of boys in a New England prep school and their teacher, Mr Keating (Robin Williams) is in production as an   play opening next month. It’s ostensibly a story about Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) a sensitive lad whose theatrical ambitions conflict with his authoritarian father’s preferences, and Keating, who   the boys into writing poetry and seizing the day. However, the real star of the movie is Charlie “Nuwanda” Dalton, the   of the bunch with a great deal of personal style,   lightning bolt body art and sax abilities. Nuwanda is character with an enduring fandom and cultural relevance. “Damn it Neil, the name is Nuwanda” is a phrase will always hold up a little flag for nonconformists in the face of overwhelming institutional crushing.  Nuwanda was played by Gale Hansen, who didn’t do much acting after that, while many of his classmates from Welton Academy (Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles) have been working steadily since then.  With a play in the works, these acting trajectories will undoubtedly become the focus of renewed interest, with the “where are they now” features and listicles. One of the purposes of these types of articles, it seems to me, is to shame those who “didn’t do anything” afterwards, except for, I don’t know, live their lives. There’s an accusation there: why aren’t you more famous?  The phrase “  wonder” certainly implies that it’s a wonder you ever had a hit because you never followed it up. Your lack of   is automatically a bad thing. But why is a truly singular performance, or one number one hit, or one perfect book something to disdain? Isn’t greatness greatness? Why would it be better if, say, one had a slew of mediocre performances or songs or books? Excellence  —   having created something that people still love and connect to decades later  —   should stand regardless of whether someone goes on to be prolific. I’ve read Limahl (he of the   group Kajagoogoo) say that he doesn’t mind singing Too Shy over and over again because it means a lot to people in the audience, as it reminds them of specific moments in their youth. If you doubt that Too Shy is excellent, please take a NSFW moment and listen to the first 30 seconds.  I seem to love a strange amount of personal bests. Favorite Bond  ? George Lazenby, On her Majesty’s Secret Service. Favorite Von Trapp? Leisl, played by Charmian Carr. My favorite movie performance? Jason Miller in the Exorcist. A pitfall of onceness is that disappearance comes more easily. I love the   series Rubicon, but it’s unavailable despite having been broadcast in 2010. I happened upon a worn paperback book called the Auctioneer and read it voraciously, and wondered why the author, Joan Samson, hadn’t written any more books despite a cover line trumpeting SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE. That major motion picture was never made, and Samson died of cancer. There may be a bit of fear and jealousy involved with the disdain of wonders. Fear that even if one can reach some fairly lofty heights, there’s no guarantee it will happen again, despite all efforts. Fate is fickle. Why not decades of Gale Hansen films? Sometimes the gods are just assholes. And maybe, at the core, there’s a   sadness because you, the fan, would like to have   more of that art.  But sometimes more isn’t better. See: Go Set a Watchman. I wish Hansen had appeared in more films and television shows many Dead Poets Society fans feel that way. I don’t know how he feels about it. Maybe he didn’t want to act any more. It’s a selfish wish, really, to demand that someone who gave you something precious, who created a work of art that has stayed with you for decades, give you more.  Maybe   “  wonders” are so incandescent that, perfection having been achieved, the artist can drop the mic, so to speak. This list of the top   wonders according to Spotify shows a list of songs that are still in heavy rotation on my radio regardless of its creators lacking subsequent hits.  Ongoing mediocrity is transient.

79,’The saga is over’: Gawker reaches $31m settlement with Hulk Hogan,"Gawker Media has agreed to pay former wrestler Hulk Hogan $31m (£25m) to settle a   legal battle that forced the company to file for bankruptcy and its eponymous gossip website to close down. The news site, which filed for bankruptcy this summer after a jury ordered it to pay $140m in damages to Hogan for the website’s publication of a sex tape featuring the wrestler, agreed to forego an appeal and pay a cash settlement deal, according to legal filings on Wednesday. The lawsuit against Gawker was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire and Donald Trump donor Peter Thiel.  After four years of litigation funded by a billionaire with a grudge going back even further, a settlement has been reached, Gawker founder Nick Denton said in a blog post. “The saga is over. ” Denton, a British journalist who founded Gawker in 2002 with an aim to report on the media and establishment elite, said he was confident that the appeals court would reduce or eliminate the $140m “runaway Florida judgment”.  “But   legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight. The Valley billionaire, famously relentless, had committed publicly to support Hulk Hogan beyond the appeal and ‘until his final victory’. Gawker’s nemesis was not going away. ” As part of the settlement, three Gawker stories, including the Hogan one, will be deleted from the internet.  A spokesman for Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said: “As with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on. ” Thiel, a   of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has spent about $10m sponsoring the lawsuit against Gawker. He had also secretly funded a team of lawyers to track down “victims” of Gawker and help fund their lawsuits against the company.  He fell out with Gawker and Denton after the website outed him as gay in 2007 with the headline: “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people. ” Denton is also gay.  “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” Thiel has said of sponsoring Hogan’s legal action. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest   …     I thought it was worth fighting back. ” He said funding the lawsuit was one of the “greater philanthropic things that I’ve done”.  Gawker Media, which included several other websites including Jezebel, Gizmodo and Deadspin, was sold out of bankruptcy to     media company Univision for $135m. Gawker was permanently closed.  Gawker started life in Denton’s Manhattan apartment with a mission to expose celebrities and the media elite.

80,’Democracy was hijacked. It got a bad name’: the death of the post-Soviet dream,"The road out of Kommunizm, a small town in southern Tajikistan, is badly paved and bumpy. Like most things here it was built long ago, when the ruling ideology that gave the settlement its name was still thriving. Home to just 7, 000 inhabitants, Kommunizm was at the very edge of the Russian empire, first tsarist then Soviet a mere 50 miles from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. All around the former collective farm is the once splendid iconography of the Bolshevik order. Busts of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin look on to what used to be the main square, while a trio of heroically poised Soviet archetypes have been cast to one side in a car park. On the stage at the Palace of Youth, a building with wide white columns and a grand central hall with gilded chandeliers, a portrait of Lenin has been replaced by the gently smiling visage of Emomali Rahmon, president of Tajikistan. But apart for the omnipresent Rahmon, there is not much new in Kommunizm. Things have merely decayed. Like the rest of Tajikistan and the four other former Soviet “Stans”  —   Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan  —   Kommunizm is marking 25 years of independence, thanks to the   collapse of the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1991. But for all the overblown rhetoric and parades across the region, the celebrations had a bittersweet tinge. While efforts at nation building in the newly independent countries have had some success, the collapse of the planned economy and its replacement with kleptocratic regimes has meant the standard of living for most people in the region has sharply declined over the past quarter of a century. In Kommunizm’s Palace of Youth, the paint peels from the walls, and visitors have to zigzag to avoid falling through rotten sections of the flooring. It is hard to avoid the weight of the metaphor. The “Stans” occupy a chunk of land that has always been at the crossroads of empires: China to the east, Russia to the north, Turkey to the west, Afghanistan and India to the south. In the 19th century, London and St Petersburg jostled over the territory in what was known as the Great Game, with the Russian and British empires just a few miles apart at points in the Pamir mountains. In the aftermath of the   attacks, the “war on terror” saw many people speak of a “new great game” as the US moved airbases into the region to support the Afghan war effort. But even as global powers jostled over central Asia, the region remained little known and mainly ignored, except for satire of its dictatorships and apparent backwardness  —   Sacha Baron Cohen’s hapless Kazakh reporter Borat, or the recent British comedy The Ambassadors, following British diplomats in (fictional) Tazbekistan. Last year, a New York Times typo saw the accidental invention of a brand new state: Kyrzbekistan.  Local intellectuals bristle at these caricatures, and point out that the region is home to many great civilisations the ornate   and   manuscripts on display at Tajikistan’s national museum are a reminder of the sophisticated societies that previously flourished here. But it is the legacy of the Soviet Union, the most recent empire to control the lands, which is most in evidence today, from the steppe of northern Kazakhstan to the cotton fields on Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan. Across the region,   mosaics depicting happy nomads embracing socialism and strapping athletes bringing glory to the joint motherland are surrounded by decaying infrastructure.  In Kommunizm, as across the region, the socialist art is less about any real Soviet past, and more about the memory of an imagined happy future, now gone forever. “We knew things were difficult then, but the party told us that tomorrow everything would be better. We knew there was a plan and in five years or 10 years it would all be better. But now we don’t know what will happen tomorrow we’ve lost that hope,” said Medetkhan Sherimkulov, who was the Kyrgyz Soviet republic’s head of ideology in the 1980s and now teaches political science at a Bishkek university. As a bright young communist cadre, Sherimkulov earned a philosophy PhD at Moscow State University in the 1970s, specialising in transitional societies. He planned to put his knowledge to use in the continuing mission to Sovietise central Asia, but he ended up managing a shift in the opposite direction. As speaker of the first Kyrgyz parliament, it is his signature on Kyrgyzstan’s declaration of independence, ushering into existence a country he neither wanted nor expected. “We lived for 70 years with the Soviet Union you can’t expect us to transition to a democracy overnight. If you try to make the transition too quickly, chaos ensues,” said Sherimkulov over tea and plov (pilaf) in a Bishkek teahouse. “You are used to your own system, and then it changes overnight. Imagine if in England they turned it into a dictatorship overnight. You can’t transition that quickly. Democracy was hijacked by demagogues. It was spoiled, and got a bad reputation. ”  In the early 1990s, Communist party bosses in the region reincarnated themselves as national leaders, stepping into the ideological vacuum with new legends and heroes, often with scant attention to historical fact. In Astana and Ashgabat, the Kazakh and Turkmen leaderships built gaudy, fantastical cities from scratch, projections of the golden ages to which their nations were purportedly headed. Lenins were replaced by billboards of smiling presidents, just as omnipresent as the Soviet leaders once were, and equally hagiographic. In Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, it is nearly impossible to find a point in the city from which a portrait of Rahmon is not in the sightline. Here he cradles sheaves of wheat pensively, there he sips a cup of tea or wags a finger in a meeting. Most often, in the   shots that cover the facades of whole buildings, he strides purposefully, into a glorious Tajik future that is remarkably absent from any reality existing outside the world of the billboards. The Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, went even further and had a gold statue of himself erected. He has been officially styled as Arkadag, “the protector” Rahmon is the “founder of peace and national unity” while Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev is merely Elbasy, “leader of the nation”. There is talk of renaming the capital, Astana, in his honour. The laws anointing the men with these titles typically also provide them and their families with immunity from prosecution, and indeed, behind the personality cults and nationalism is something more basic and venal. In all five countries, family members and close associates of the rulers have enriched themselves. Central Asia is one of the world’s most corrupt regions, but foreign businessmen and politicians have had few qualms about coddling the region’s autocrats, keen to access resources and use airbases, as foreign adventurers on the silk route once courted emirs for trading rights. Moral clarity has been in short supply. The then British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, was fired in 2004 after speaking out against human rights abuses in the country, perhaps the most repressive autocracy of them all. A decade later, and Karimov was still being courted by western politicians. “Uzbekistan is an important partner in bringing peace, prosperity to central Asia. Good discussion   President Karimov,” secretary of state John Kerry wrote on Twitter in 2015 about a man who was accused of boiling his opponents alive. Kerry accompanied the tweet with a photograph of the two men shaking hands and smiling. Karimov, who was the first secretary of the Uzbek Soviet republic and then Uzbekistan’s first president, died a few days short of his country’s 25th birthday. He left a legacy of poverty, forced labour and strict censorship. His death, rather than ushering in a period of openness, has merely seen one of his associates take over the reins.  Of the five countries, only in Kyrgyzstan has there been an enforced change of leadership revolutions twice rising up to wash away corrupt rulers, one of whom fled to Moscow and another, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, to Belarus. His son Maxim made a dash to London in his private jet, with what Kyrgyz authorities allege is hundreds of millions of dollars of pilfered public money. “I pleaded with the Americans to go after him. Putting him in an orange suit would be the best thing imaginable to happen to   relations,” said Edil Baisalov, briefly chief of staff to the interim president after the Bakiyev family was deposed in a 2010 revolution. Instead, the Americans dropped the case against him, and Bakiyev Jr is rumoured to be living comfortably in Surrey. Kyrgyzstan’s current president, Almazbek Atambayev, has gained a reputation as an impulsive and erratic leader, and International Crisis Group’s Deirdre Tynan described the country’s politics as “perpetual   chaos”. The revolution that deposed the Bakiyev clan was followed by terrible ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan, where there is a large ethnic Uzbek population. More than 400 people were killed. The country’s violent recent past has led many to wonder whether a stable autocracy might be better than a relatively liberal state with revolutionary energy and freedom of speech. But while applying western standards of democracy to central Asia may be naive, there is no doubt that the dictatorships have not, on the whole, brought   prosperity. For the vast majority of citizens in the five countries, everyday life is hard work, and most are significantly worse off than during the Soviet period. The societies are still recovering from what they lost in the Soviet collapse. “In any central Asian country, if there was a referendum on some kind of integration project that would basically be a new Soviet Union, at least   of people would vote for it,” said Parviz Mullojanov, a political analyst in Dushanbe. In the 1970s, the city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan was around 50% Russian. Arsen Ambaryan, an ethnic Armenian lawyer who has lived in Osh most of his life, recalled that of the 30 children in his 1977   class, about 20 were Russians. Only one of them still lives in Osh.  The rest all left during the early   period. The Russians tended to be professionals: doctors, teachers, engineers, and their departure took a huge toll on the societies they left behind. Many professional Uzbeks, Kyrgyz and Tajiks also left for Russia, taking advantage of easy citizenship programmes in the 1990s. They left behind societies with poor healthcare and broken education systems. Grandparents tend to be better educated than their grandchildren across much of the region. As well as lost intellectual capital, much of the industrial infrastructure also fell into decay in the years after the Soviet collapse, as it did elsewhere in the former Soviet lands, from Siberia to east Ukraine, leaving social devastation in its wake. “Our factories were well developed and were high class by [Soviet] Union standards, but of course they couldn’t compete with European and Chinese factories. So as soon as the union collapsed, and we lost that integration and that planned economy market, everything was in trouble,” said Sherimkulov, the former party boss. With jobs in central Asia in short supply, young men have had to migrate, usually to Russia, to do unskilled labour to send money home to sustain their families. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have natural resources that swell the state coffers, but in the other three countries, remittances from migrant workers are what keeps the economies afloat. In Tajikistan, they account for around half of GDP. In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, it is hard to find a man in his 20s or 30s who has not been to Russia to work. Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, is plastered with advertisements for buses making the gruelling   journey across the steppe to the Russian capital. Across the region, thousands of men depart each day to Moscow and other cities across Russia, where they work in grim conditions with few labour rights, for poor salaries that are nevertheless much better than they could expect at home. National borders wind their way through communities, frequently with no apparent logic. They are another difficult legacy from the Soviet period, designed to mark not international boundaries but internal administrative jurisdictions. In a situation where the new nations are creating new nationalisms, minority populations excluded from national   enhance the potential for unrest. In northern Kazakhstan, large communities of ethnic Russians make Kazakh authorities nervous about a potential “Crimea scenario”.  Further south, in the densely populated Fergana Valley, the wavy, overlapping borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are hangovers from the Soviet borders, and often appear as if drawn at random by a drunkard holding a pencil. Particularly tricky is the presence of several exclaves  —   towns belonging to one country placed well inside the borders of another. The town of Sokh, for example, is part of Uzbekistan, but fully surrounded by Kyrgyzstan, and its 20, 000 population are almost entirely ethnic Tajiks. Shepherds are frequently shot by border guards, while people trying to go to the next village for shopping or visiting relatives are subject to border checks and corrupt officials trying to extort bribes to allow them to cross. But the most alarming menace lurking at the door is radical Islam. Over the centuries, central Asian societies were traditionally Islamic, though religion was repressed in the Soviet period. In the newly independent states, Islam is back, but the paranoid regimes frown on any kind of conservative Islam, even   forms. In Turkmenistan, beards have been banned and attendance at mosques discouraged while in Tajikistan, police keep a watchlist of veiled women and men with long beards. Even in relatively liberal Kyrgyzstan, giant billboards have appeared in recent months across the country, showing women in traditional Kyrgyz dress on one side, and wearing black veils on the other, with the question posed, “Where are we headed?” With   conservative Islam frowned upon in the region, a trickle of people are moving across to violent extremism.  An Islamic State video released in 2015 purported to show dozens of young Kazakh boys receiving training and instruction at a terrorist training camp, presumably in Syria. Kazakhstan has seen two purported Isis inspired attacks this summer, including a July incident in which four police officers and one civilian were killed by gunfire in the financial capital, Almaty. Most dramatically, the chief of Tajikistan’s Omon riot police Gulmurod Khalimov, rumoured to be a   sniper and favourite of the president, disappeared last year and resurfaced in an Isis propaganda video promising to hunt down and kill Americans. While it is clear that there is a radicalism problem, rights activists say the governments have used the fight against extremism to go after moderates and dissenters. In Tajikistan, the Islamic Renaissance party, a moderate Islamic force calling for a secular state with religious freedoms, has been hounded into exile. Hundreds of its supporters have been rounded up and jailed. Shabnam Khudodoydova, a Tajik woman living in Russia, also reported persecution under the guise of a crackdown on extremism. After she began to post in opposition political forums and writing that the Rahmon regime had “made slaves and sheep” out of the Tajik people, she noticed she was being followed in St Petersburg, and fled to Belarus. There she was arrested, beaten up in custody by men she believes were Tajik security agents, and held in jail for several months, before being released and fleeing to Poland.  She later discovered she had been put on the Interpol watchlist, accused of being a recruiter for Isis. “I am not a terrorist, I’m not an Islamist, I’m actually an atheist. I’ve never even believed in God,” she said by Skype from Poland. There is now a chicken and egg situation: the governments of the region claim their repressive policies are a response to the very real threat posed by Isis and other Islamist movements.  Cynics suggest that the suffocating stranglehold on political and religious life leaves no middle ground: for those who want an escape from the confines of the regime, extremism can be the only option. “When you push out the moderate Islamic alternatives you leave more potential for people to get radicalised,” said one western diplomat based in the region. In   a town not far from Osh on the border with Uzbekistan, the imam of the local mosque, Rashot Kamalov, has been jailed for calling for an Islamic caliphate.  In a grimy teahouse not far from the town’s teeming market, Dilyar Jumabayev, a supporter of Kamalov, said the imam had not called for people to go to Syria, but merely preached about current injustices. The region, mainly made up of ethnic Uzbeks, is poor on the road from Osh the carcasses of Soviet industrial plants lie derelict and abandoned. Police keep a close eye on Jumabayev, and during one search of his house, he was beaten and had his front teeth kicked out. He was later sentenced to 10 months in prison for resisting arrest. “What has democracy brought us in 25 years? I was never a fan of the Soviet Union but at least people worked then. Now there is no work, the factories have closed. I am selling everything in my house including the refrigerator so that I can afford medicine,” he said. In Osh, lawyer Khusanbay Saliyev is dealing with hundreds of cases for possession of extremist literature, and said he believed about 90% of them to be fabricated by paranoid and avaricious authorities. “There is torture and repression, and it has the opposite effect, pushing people into the arms of the radicals,” he said. The dictatorships of central Asia are now at a crossroads. Outwardly, they appear more or less stable. Deaths of dictators, in Turkmenistan a decade ago, and this year in Uzbekistan, have led not to political change but simply to a new autocrat taking over, in what at least to outside eyes were relatively smooth processes.  All the leaders remain adept at playing off major powers for maximum benefit. “Of course, when he’s speaking to me he’ll say everything he knows I want to hear, and if he’s speaking to the Russians he’ll say everything they want to hear,” said a western diplomat about the president of the country in which he is based. But across the region, growing populations remain in poverty, and the Russian economic crisis of the past two years has put a huge dent in remittances. Standards of healthcare and education show little sign of improving, and the systems are too stubborn and entrenched to allow for real reform. “Even in the best case scenario, central Asia has very problematic and difficult times ahead. The economics are not working any more,” said Mullojanov, the   analyst. Seventy years of Soviet rule followed by a quarter century of autocracy have beaten out the impulse to protest from most central Asians. When revolt has erupted, it has either led to new governments following the status quo, as in Kyrgyzstan, or to violent, ruthless crackdown, as in Uzbekistan’s Andijan in 2005. Even moderate criticism can lead to jail sentences or worse.  In   Jumabayev chose his words carefully, but said the direction of movement was clear: “If a civilisational form doesn’t carry out its obligations to the people, then other forms of civilisation will inevitably develop. We saw it happen with communism, which was overtaken by democracy. Now, we are seeing the same thing happen to democracy. ”",road kommunizm small town southern tajikistan badli pave bumpi like thing built long rule ideolog gave settlement name still thrive home

81,Drink: my resolution for 2017? Try things I haven’t had before,"It always surprises me how different most people’s approach to wine is from their approach to food. While we have an apparently insatiable appetite for new ingredients and recipes, there seems to be much less curiosity around booze. If I were talking to you about how to become a better cook in 2017, I’d suggest making a commitment to try at least one new recipe a month, so why not make it a goal regularly to try a drink you haven’t had before? It’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking you don’t like certain drinks, such as beer or whisky, when it’s probably more a question of not having found one you like. If you’re a whisky sceptic, say, why not try a younger, fruitier kind that has none of the peaty notes that are characteristic of many bottles of Scotch? I don’t know if I’m being unduly fanciful here, but I definitely picked up mango in Rampur Select (£40. 95 The Whisky Exchange 43% abv) a new   whisky from India, as well as a touch of apricot and dried apple. It would work beautifully (well diluted) with a good chicken curry. Put aside your prejudices about packaging, too. Many interesting beers, and even wines, now come in cans. I was very taken with the refreshing,   white wine Quello (£15 for six cans 11% abv) I tried from a stall run by Bristol retailer More Wine recently. And I think Aldi is on the right track for younger drinkers with its new “craft wines” which are bottled in squat,   bottles with brightly coloured labels, even though there’s room for improvement with the contents. If you’ve a sweet tooth, I hazard that you’ll enjoy the No Monkey Business White Moskato (£2. 49 for 50cl 5. 5% abv) which I’d serve  . So far as wine is concerned, the fact that you haven’t heard of something is in my book good reason to order it from a wine list or as part of a mixed case. German reds, for example, such as the vibrantly fruity Aldinger Lemberger 2015 (£11. 95 The Wine Society 13% abv) are relatively undiscovered gems. (For the geeks, lemberger is the same grape variety as Austria’s blaufränkisch.) My own resolution is to get better acquainted in 2017 with three drinks that have already been on my radar: sake, kombucha and   tea. You could start with the fragrant Chiyomusubi Oyaji Gokuraku Junmai Ginjo Cup Sake (£8. 95 souschefdirect. co. uk 16% abv) which I found was an unexpectedly good partner for a plate of emmental cheese (which will please my   editor). And it’s sold in a jar.

82,The reality of being black in today’s Britain,"When I was a child, growing up on a council estate in the northeast of England, I imbibed enough of the background racial tensions of the late 1970s and 1980s to feel profoundly unwelcome in Britain. My right, not just to regard myself as a British citizen, but even to be in Britain, seemed contested. Despite our mother’s careful protection, the tenor of our times seeped through the concrete walls into our home and into my mind and into my siblings’ minds. Secretly, I harboured fears that as part of the group identified by chanting   hostile neighbours and even television comedians as “them” we might be sent “back”. This, in our case, presumably meant “back” to Nigeria, a country of which I had only infant memories and a land upon which my youngest siblings had never set foot. To thousands of younger black and   Britons who, thankfully, cannot remember those decades, the racism of the 1970s and 1980s and the insecurities it bred in the minds of black people are difficult to imagine or relate to. But they are powerful memories for my generation. I was eight years old when the BBC finally cancelled The Black and White Minstrel Show. I have memories of my mother rushing across our living room to change television channels (in the days before remote controls) to avoid her   children being confronted by grotesque caricatures of themselves on   television. I was 17 when the last of the touring blackface minstrel shows finally disappeared, having clung on for a decade performing in fading ballrooms on the decaying piers of Britain’s seaside towns. I grew up in a Britain in which there were pictures of golliwogs on jam jars and golliwog dolls alongside the teddy bears in the toy shop windows. One of the worst moments of my unhappy schooling was when, during the   to a 1970s Christmas, we were allowed to bring in our favourite toys. The girl who innocently brought her golliwog doll into our classroom plunged me into a day of humiliation and pain that I still find painful to recall, decades later. When, in recent years, I have been assured that such dolls, and the words “golliwog” and “wog” are in fact harmless and that opposition to them is a symptom of rampant political correctness, I recall another incident. It is difficult to regard a word as benign when it has been scrawled on to a note, wrapped around a brick and thrown through one’s   window in the dead of night, as happened to my family when I was 14. That scribbled note reiterated the demand that me and my siblings be sent “back”. In the early 21st century, politicians in Whitehall and researchers in thinktanks fret about the failures of   communities to properly integrate into British society. In my childhood, the resistance seemed, to me at least, to come from the opposite direction. Many   people felt that while it was possible to be in Britain it was much harder to be of Britain. They felt marked out and unwanted whenever they left the confines of family or community. It was a place and a time in which “black” meant “other” and “black” was unquestionably the opposite of “British”. The phrase “black British” with which we are so familiar today, was little heard in those years. In the minds of some it spoke of an impossible duality. In the face of such hostility, many black British people, and their white and   family members, slipped into a siege mentality, a state of mind from which it has been difficult to entirely escape. What drove us deeper into that citadel of   and watchful mistrust was not just racial prejudice but a wave of racial violence. Throughout those embattled years, my mother, somehow, managed to maintain within our family a regime of   and  . It was this internal, familial microculture that slowly drew me to read history. I stumbled upon the subject that was to become my vocation out of a simple love of story and because of a   fascination with the Second World War that was almost obligatory among boys of that period, whatever their racial background. Britain in the 1980s was a nation still saturated in the culture and paraphernalia of that conflict. For the white   community that I grew up in, the war was the most exciting and significant event ever to collide with our terraced streets and decaying factories. It had changed the lives of my white grandparents, whom I loved deeply, and I was intoxicated by the thought that German bombers had prowled the skies above my home town and that my grandfather had scanned those skies while on watch on the roof of the Vickers Armstrong factory by the Tyne, where he worked building tanks. I wandered into history looking for excitement. I never expected that there I would encounter black and brown people who were like me and my family. I was alerted to those stories of presence and participation by my white mother and I stumbled across more and more stories of black British people as my interests took me further back, into the 19th and then the 18th century. In 1986, I came across the book Staying Power by the British journalist Peter Fryer. It was, I believe, the first book I ever bought for myself. This history of the black presence in Britain was published in 1984, the year in which my family had been besieged in our home, and it set the racism that had so deeply affected our lives within a historical context. It allowed me to understand my own experiences as part of a longer story and to appreciate that in an age when black men were dying on the floors of police cells, my own encounters with British racism had been relatively mild. For me and for thousands of black and white people who read Fryer’s book, its effect was transformative. Fryer took his readers back through the centuries and introduced us to an enormous pantheon of black historical characters, about whom we had previously known nothing. Those black Britons have been with me ever since. I have visited their graves and read their letters and memoirs. They have become part of British history and in some cases part of the national curriculum. Staying Power remains a uniquely important book and anyone who has ever written about black history has found themselves referencing it, quoting from it or seeking out some of the myriad of primary sources it drew together. Fryer’s eloquent chapters offer guidance and provide orientation through a complex and fractured history. Although not the first work of black British history, its impact spread further than most, in part because its publication came at a crucial moment, three years after a wave of riots sparked by hostile policing set ablaze black neighbourhoods of London, Bristol and Liverpool. There was a terrible symmetry to the fact that the most serious and sustained of the early 1980s riots took place in the cities from which the   had set sail in the 17th and 18th centuries. Cities that had been enriched by the slave trade and the sugar business saw fires set and barricades erected by young people who were the distant descendants of those “human cargos”. Not far from the flickering flames of the Bristol riots, a statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader and member of the Royal African Company in the 17th century, looked on as the police were driven out of the black St Pauls district. The riots of the early 1980s were profoundly different from the disturbances of 1919, 1948 and 1958, all of which were at various times described as “race riots” but were mostly outbursts of violence in which white gangs targeted black people and communities. This was not the case in the 1980s. These riots have been called “uprisings”. They were fought by young black people in response to years of systematic persecution and prejudice. They were destructive and damaging but they were understandable. While it is clear today that the riots marked the beginning of the end of one chapter, the nature of the new age that followed remains to be seen. The 1990s and the 2000s were, in many ways, better days. Survey after survey plotted the decline of racist sentiment as a younger generation emerged who had not experienced the racism of the postwar period nor been brought up to view the world in racial terms. Yet this period was the era in which the name of Stephen Lawrence was added to the long list of black Britons who have been murdered by racists. Historians tend to be cautious when it comes to commentating on the modern age, the period through which we are currently living. For me, the period from the 1980s onwards is the one I know from personal memory as well as through historical study, which probably clouds more than it clarifies judgment. But I strongly recall that in the 1980s there was a strong sense among black people of being under siege and of feeling the need to fight for a place and a future in the country. One of the ways in which black people, and their white allies, attempted to secure that future was by reclaiming their lost past. The uncovering of black British history was so important because the present was so contested. Black history became critical to the generation whom Enoch Powell could not bring himself to see as British. A history was needed to demonstrate to all that black British children, born of immigrant parents, were part of a longer story that stretched back to the   whose remains are only now being properly identified. It was in the 1980s that the concept of Black History Month was brought to Britain, an idea that had been pioneered in the United States back in the 1920s, as “Negro History Week”. Black History Month was needed in Britain because the black past had been largely buried and it was during the 1980s that the task of exhumation took on real urgency. Unusually, history became critical to a whole community, while at the same time becoming highly personal to those who discovered it. To look at the portrait of Olaudah Equiano for the first time, and stare into the eyes of a black Georgian, was, for me, as for many thousands of black Britons, a profound experience. To see Equiano, with his cravat and scarlet coat, was to feel the embrace of the past and of a deeper belonging. The black British history that was written in the 1980s was built on the foundations of earlier scholars such as James Walvin and was expanded by hundreds of committed volunteers local historians, community historians and brilliant, determined, sometimes obsessive amateurs. Most worked and still work outside of academia, producing local history or uncovering the presence of black people in parts of the British story from which they have been expunged  —   the world wars, the history of seafaring, the world of entertainment and many others. It is hard to believe that without the recent decades of black history research and writing, the nation, in 2007, would have committed £20m to commemorate the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade. A sum that matched, by chance, the price the nation had paid the slave owners in compensation for the loss of their human property in 1838. The next step, I contend, is to expand the horizon and reimagine black British history as not just a story that took place in Britain, and not just as the story of settlement, although it matters enormously. From the 16th century onwards, Britain exploded like a supernova, radiating its power and influence across the world. Black people were placed at the centre of that revolution. Our history is global, transnational, triangular and much of it is still to be written. The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, a vast, globally televised pageant that celebrated the British national story, which revelled in the nation’s diversity, music and pop culture, included a   miniature Empire Windrush. This replica was made of a metal frame around which had been stretched fabric printed with the covers of hundreds of postwar British newspapers. She appeared in the Olympic stadium as one among a series of symbolic representations of the pivotal events in British history: the Industrial Revolution, the First World War, the campaigns of the suffragettes, the Jarrow march of 1936 and the creation of the NHS in 1948, the year the Windrush docked at Tilbury. Britain’s black population today stands at around two million, a little more than 3% of the national total. There had been, at most, a few thousand black Londoners in 1948. The history symbolised by the Windrush has become a part of the British story, in a way that no one who attended the 1948 Olympic Games could have possibly imagined. The Empire Windrush has entered the folklore and vocabulary of the nation. There is a Windrush Square in Brixton, a heritage plaque in Tilbury marks the spot where the ship docked and the West Indian migrants came ashore, and a musical based on the lives and ambitions of the Windrush migrants enjoyed a successful run in London’s West End. But this triumph of remembering has come at a cost. The symbolic power of the Windrush moment has at times obscured the deeper and longer black history. As well as losing sight of the more distant past, our focus on the postwar story has meant that, at times, we have been slow to recognise more recent changes. Since the start of the 1980s, Britain has undergone a second great wave of black migration, one that has largely gone unnoticed. This new influx lacked a single iconic moment, comparable to the docking of the Windrush in 1948, and it took place in the far less romantic settings of Gatwick and Heathrow airports, but it was in those great hubs of modern air travel that thousands of Africans arrived, despite ever stricter immigration laws. At the turn of the century, West Indians still made up the majority of the UK’s black population. But, as the 2011 census revealed, between 2001 and 2011, the British African population doubled, through both migration and natural increase. For the first time, probably, since the age of the Atlantic slave trade, the majority of black Britons or their parents have come to this country directly from Africa, rather than from somewhere in the Americas. The migrants from West Africa were mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians and tended to be a little wealthier than the West Indians who had come before them, but were certainly not wealthy by global standards. Some came initially to study but ended up staying. Others migrated to join family and set up home or to take up employment in a Britain that was still hungry for skilled workers. Many of those who arrived from Somalia, Zimbabwe and Sudan came as refugees. The long queues at Britain’s airports of British Africans travelling to Accra, Freetown or Lagos to attend family reunions, weddings or funerals speak to the strengths of the new connections between Britain and Africa. The great postwar project to build an   multiracial Commonwealth with London at its heart, a community of willing nations led by statesmen and businessmen, has, in a sense, been overtaken by globalisation and unprecedented levels of world migration. In a form that the politicians of the 1940s did not envisage, London remains at the centre of the former empire. The capital has become a node in a vast global network of family connections, remittances, investment and mobility. Despite the questionable attractions of nearer Dubai, millions of Africans still feel powerfully drawn to London. While the British African population expands, the West Indian population, longer established and more fully integrated, has amalgamated and assimilated more successfully than perhaps any other immigrant group of modern times. The remarkable capacity of West Indian immigrant families to assimilate can be seen in the marriage statistics. Fewer than half of British West Indians have partners who are also West Indian. According to the Economist, “a child under 10 who has a Caribbean parent is more than twice as likely as not to have a white parent”. While West Indians have drawn millions of white British people into their family networks, they and the African migrants have drawn the whole nation towards their cultures and music. Through sports, music, cinema, fashion and (only latterly) television, black Britons have become the standard bearers of a new cultural and national identity, the globalised hybrid version of Britishness that was so successfully and confidently expressed in 2012. These successes and achievements have been remarkable and in many ways unexpected. The problem is that these good news stories can at times become window dressing and inspire wishful thinking. The reality is that disadvantages are still entrenched and discrimination remains rife. A report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission published in August showed that black graduates in Britain were paid an average 23. 1% less than similarly qualified white workers. It revealed that since 2010 there had been a 49% increase in the number of ethnic minority   to    who were   unemployed, while in the same period there had been a fall of 2% in   unemployment among white people in the same age category. Black workers are also more than twice as likely to be in insecure forms of employment such as temporary contracts or working for an agency. Black people are far more often the victims of crime. “You are more than twice as likely to be murdered if you are black in England and Wales,” said the report, starkly. When accused of crimes, black people are three times more likely to be prosecuted and sentenced than white people. When, as a young man, I began to study history I came to see it as a way to understand the forces that had brought my parents together, shaping my own experiences. Like millions of others, I am a product of Britain’s long involvement with Africa: a history of slave trading and colonisation, but also of traders, missionaries and the Saro people who, having been liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy, returned to Nigeria from Sierra Leone, bringing to Lagos  —   the city of my birth  —   their Anglican faith and their hybrid   identity. My parents were able to meet in the Britain of the 1960s due to links that had been established in the late 19th century between communities, schools and churches in Lagos, Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa and universities in the north of England. The racist attacks that, two decades later, led to me and my family being driven from our home by thugs inspired by the National Front were a feature of another inescapable aspect of that same history  —   the development and spread of British racism. The walls of disadvantage that today block the paths of young black Britons are a mutated product of the same racism. Knowing this history better, understanding the forces it has unleashed, and seeing oneself as part of a longer story, is one of the ways in which we can keep trying to move forward.

84,Hillary Clinton poised to win popular vote despite losing presidential race,"If current projections hold, Hillary Clinton will soon become the second presidential nominee to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college  —   and thus the White House  —   in the past five US presidential elections. Clinton, who gave a speech on Wednesday conceding to her victorious Republican opponent Donald Trump, is poised to lose the electoral college tally by a decisive 74 votes (nearly 14% of the total available) while carrying a slim majority of the overall votes cast. As of Wednesday afternoon Clinton led by more than 200, 000 votes, with 47. 7% to Trump’s 47. 5%. It would be the fifth time in the nation’s history that such a split has occurred and may be a boon to advocates of reform of the    system. “We’re hoping that this will bring further attention when we start lobbying state legislatures next term,” said John Koza, a professor and author who originated legislation to replace the system that is now on the books in 11 states and could eventually bring down the electoral college.  The electoral college is a constitutional relic of a fundamentally different nation, one with 13 states and a potential electorate of 2. 5 million citizens, slashed dramatically by restrictions that limited the franchise to white,   Protestant men. A variety of arguments have been raised for its value, but typically it is understood by political science and history scholars as a constitutional firewall from certain kinds of potentially “undemocratic” election outcomes. One commonly cited scenario is to prevent a   candidate who is highly popular in one relatively small region from racking up impressive margins in a handful of states while more mainstream candidates split votes in a wider array of states. A practical example of this would be a segregationist candidate steamrolling the south during the civil rights era, while a Democrat and a Republican split the rest of the country. But the institution has long been seen by most as a vestigial remnant of a bygone era. In public opinion polls, Americans of all political affiliations resoundingly support a direct presidential election. Trump himself leveled a critique in 2012 when Barack Obama won   in the popular and electoral vote handily. In 2000, George W Bush defeated Al Gore on a   margin of five electoral votes while losing the popular vote by more than a half million votes. While the outcome did prompt conversations about the fairness and usefulness of the electoral college, the historic recount, and peculiar issues surrounding “hanging chads” and “butterfly ballots” tempered that somewhat. But in 2016, the scenario looks different. Trump’s commanding electoral college lead and his unprecedentedly high unfavorable ratings in opinion polls both add dramatically to the dissonance of the outcome.  However, congressional efforts to retire the electoral college have not gained serious traction since a 1934 Senate vote to switch to a direct election failed by just two votes. The arguments then were not dissimilar to the ones advocates offer now. Senator Diane Feinstein of California has tried to build support for a direct election several times over her past three terms, arguing in 2007 that “every vote should be treated equally regardless of the state in which it is cast”. Regardless, there has been no open floor debate on this issue since 1979. One potential workaround that has been proposed is Koza’s   national popular vote legislation. Instead of pushing for a constitutional amendment, which would require   of Congress to sign on, campaign organizers seek to convince state legislatures to pledge their state’s delegates to the winner of the national popular vote. The new method would only become effective once enough states (270 electoral votes’ worth) sign on. Koza’s campaign would not technically abolish the electoral college, but it would ensure that the candidate with the most votes was named the winner of presidential elections. The national popular vote would also end the intense focus on swing states such as Florida and Ohio that frequently change hands and that have characterized the modern US presidential election for decades. Some critics argue that without such battlegrounds, candidates would ignore rural Americans to focus attention on urban centers with high densities of voters.  National popular vote advocates counter that, under the current system, only about 12 battleground states ever get any attention anyway. Right now, the states that have enacted national popular vote bills represent 165 electoral college votes, largely thanks to California with its mammoth 55 votes. All 11  —   including Illinois, New Jersey and Washington  —   are considered safe Democratic states. Koza said that was less a function of how partisan the idea is and more a reflection of where the country was when the campaign was launched. “When we started in 2007, GWB was president so it was viewed Democratically,” Koza said. He said that in recent years, the initiative had received more bipartisan support, passing in the   Oklahoma and Arizona state houses of representatives but failing in both state senates. In addition to the 165 votes worth of states that have enacted the national popular vote, states representing another 97 votes have passed the legislation in one of their two state legislative bodies. If all those states were to adopt the national popular vote in coming years as well, that would bring the project to 262 votes, just eight shy of the threshold to functionally end the electoral college. But that might be a shakier proposition following Trump’s victory than it was before. The fact the electoral college delivered two of the last five elections to GOP candidates who lost the popular vote gives Republican lawmakers little incentive to act.",current project hold hillari clinton soon becom second presidenti nomine popular vote lose elector colleg thu white hous past five presidenti elect clinton gave speech wednesday conced victori republican oppon donald trump pois lose elector colleg talli decis vote nearli total avail carri slim major overal vote cast wednesday afternoon clinton vote trump would fifth time nation histori split occur boon advoc reform system hope bring attent start lobbi state legislatur next term said john koza professor author origin legisl replac system book state could eventu bring elector colleg elector colleg constitut relic fundament differ nation state potenti elector million citizen slash dramat restrict limit franchis white protest varieti argument rais valu typic understood polit scienc histori scholar constitut firewal certain kind potenti undemocrat elect outcom commonli cite scenario prevent candid highli popular rel small region rack impress margin hand state mainstream candid split vote wider array state practic exampl would segregationist candid steamrol south civil right democrat republican split rest countri institut long seen vestigi remnant bygon public opinion poll american polit affili resoundingli support direct presidenti elect trump level critiqu barack obama popular elector vote handili georg bush defeat gore margin five elector vote lose popular vote half million vote while outcom prompt convers fair use elector colleg histor recount peculiar issu surround hang chad butterfli ballot temper somewhat scenario look differ trump command elector colleg lead unprecedentedli high unfavor rate opinion poll dramat disson outcom howev congression effort retir elector colleg gain seriou traction sinc senat vote switch direct elect fail vote argument dissimilar one advoc offer senat dian feinstein california tri build support direct elect sever time past three term argu everi vote treat equal regardless state cast regardless open floor debat issu sinc potenti workaround propos koza nation popular vote legisl instead push constitut amend would requir congress sign campaign organ seek convinc state legislatur pledg state deleg winner nation popular vote method would becom effect enough state elector vote worth sign koza campaign would technic abolish elector colleg would ensur candid vote name winner presidenti elect nation popular vote would also intens focu swing state florida ohio frequent chang hand character modern presidenti elect decad some critic argu without battleground candid would ignor rural american focu attent urban center high densiti voter nation popular vote advoc counter current system battleground state ever attent anyway right state enact nation popular vote bill repres elector colleg vote larg thank california mammoth vote includ illinoi jersey washington consid safe democrat state koza said less function partisan idea reflect countri campaign launch when start presid view democrat koza said said recent year initi receiv bipartisan support pass oklahoma arizona state hous repres fail state senat addit vote worth state enact nation popular vote state repres anoth vote pass legisl state legisl bodi state adopt nation popular vote come year well would bring project vote eight threshold function elector colleg might shakier proposit follow trump victori fact elector colleg deliv last five elect candid lost popular vote give republican lawmak littl incent
85,US declares state of emergency in Puerto Rico over Zika epidemic,"The US government on Friday declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico as a result of a Zika epidemic. The declaration allows the US Department of Health and Human Services to award grants, access emergency funds and temporarily appoint personnel where needed, among other things. “This administration is committed to meeting the Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico with the necessary urgency,” Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a department statement. Burwell traveled to the US territory in late April to evaluate its response to the outbreak. A department spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on what immediate steps the agency may take. The announcement came hours after Puerto Rico reported 1, 914 new cases in the past week, for a total of 10, 690 since the first one was reported in December. The   virus has infected 1, 035 pregnant women, which is a concern to authorities because Zika has been tied to a severe birth defect known as microcephaly. More than 100 pregnant women infected with Zika in Puerto Rico who have given birth have had healthy babies, officials said. Puerto Rico reported the first case of microcephaly acquired on US soil in May, involving a dead fetus that a woman turned over to health authorities. No microcephaly cases have been reported since then, but federal officials say it’s only a matter of time. Governor Alejandro García Padilla said he had asked federal officials to declare a public health emergency and thanked them for their support. “Zika poses a hidden threat to future generations of Puerto Ricans, and I feel the responsibility to do everything in my power to fight the spread of it,” he said. García recently authorized the use of Bti, an organic larvicide, to fight the spread of Zika after rejecting aerial spraying with the insecticide naled as proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Puerto Rico Health Secretary Ana Rius said 90 people have been hospitalized because of Zika. Officials also say 30 people have been diagnosed with a temporary paralysis condition known as   that has been linked to Zika. Health authorities say they believe the number of Zika cases is much higher because eight of 10 people show no symptoms and many don’t go to the doctor.

86,Mexican drug leader’s mother kidnapped by vigilante group,"In one of the stranger chapters of Mexico’s drug war, angry people in a southern town have kidnapped the mother of a gang leader to demand the release of their loved ones. The government of Guerrero state said Tuesday that it was sending about 220 soldiers and police to try to defuse the situation in Totolapan. The town has been controlled for years by a drug gang boss whose proper name is Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, but who is better known as “El Tequilero”. De Alamonte has lived up to his nickname, which translates roughly as “the Tequila Drinker”. In his only known public appearance, he was captured on video drinking with the town’s  . De Alamonte mumbles inaudibly and has to be held up in a sitting position by one of his henchmen. In recent months, his gang  —   also known as the Tequileros  —   has been fighting turf battles with other gangs in the area. Last week, the Tequileros allegedly kidnapped several inhabitants of Totolapan who they wanted to extort or whom they suspected of supporting a rival. In response, a few dozen men appeared this week in the streets of Totolapan waving shotguns and hunting rifles. In a video, the men carry banners calling for action against El Tequilero and identify themselves as a “ ” force, as vigilantes are known in the region. “We urgently demand the release of the kidnap victims,” a masked man says in a statement read on the video. “We are a legitimate   force of the people. ” Among the Tequileros’ kidnap victims was a local construction engineer, Isauro de Paz Duque, who was snatched on Sunday by men who had threatened to kill him. On Monday, a woman who identified herself as de Paz Duque’s wife said on a video that townspeople had El Tequilero’s mother and would exchange the woman for her husband. “We have your mother here, Mr Tequilero,” she said. “I propose an exchange: I’ll give you your mother if you give me my husband, but I want him safe and sound. ” The state government said in a statement that a negotiating team had been sent to establish contact with the family of the missing engineer and the vigilantes and to set up a search team. “The goal of the team is to ensure that no injury is done to the missing person, nor to the mother of the head of the Tequileros gang, who has apparently been taken by the   forces,” the statement said. The government later confirmed that about five of the two dozen people being held by the vigilantes had been freed, but those freed did not include the gang boss’ mother. In late November, the Guerrero government said El Tequilero was believed to have been wounded and was hiding out with his kidnap victims in the mountains. The state attorney general headed an extensive manhunt using helicopters and troops on the ground in an unsuccessful effort to locate the gang leader. The area is a hotbed of drug trafficking, killings and extortion. It is the foot of the mountains that produce much of Mexico’s opium poppy crop. Totolapan is considered so dangerous that many outlying hamlets in the township have been abandoned by fearful residents. In 2014, the battered body of the parish priest, the Rev Ascension Acuna Osorio, was found floating in the Balsas river near the town. The emergence of vigilante groups, also known as   “community police” has become a headache for Guerrero’s government. Authorities say they understand residents’ frustration but note the groups often wind up kidnapping suspects, fighting among themselves or preventing police from doing their work. “The truth is, they are not really community forces, nor are they police,” Governor Hector Astudillo said. “They are armed groups that unfortunately carry out acts . .. that generate more violence and confrontation, rather than help. ”",stranger chapter mexico drug angri peopl southern town kidnap mother gang leader demand releas love one govern guerrero state said tuesday send soldier polic defus situat totolapan town control year drug gang boss whose proper name raybel jacobo almont better known tequilero alamont live nicknam translat roughli tequila drinker known public appear captur video drink town alamont mumbl inaud held sit posit henchmen recent month gang also known tequilero fight turf battl gang area last week tequilero allegedli kidnap sever inhabit totolapan want extort suspect support rival respons dozen appear week street totolapan wave shotgun hunt rifl video carri banner call action tequilero identifi forc vigilant known region urgent demand releas kidnap victim mask say statement read video legitim forc peopl among tequilero kidnap victim local construct engin isauro duqu snatch sunday threaten kill monday woman identifi duqu wife said video townspeopl tequilero mother would exchang woman husband mother tequilero said propos exchang give mother give husband want safe sound state govern said statement negoti team sent establish contact famili miss engin vigilant search team goal team ensur injuri done miss person mother head tequilero gang appar taken forc statement said govern later confirm five dozen peopl held vigilant freed freed includ gang boss mother late novemb guerrero govern said tequilero believ wound hide kidnap victim mountain state attorney gener head extens manhunt use helicopt troop ground unsuccess effort locat gang leader area hotb drug traffick kill extort foot mountain produc much mexico opium poppi crop totolapan consid danger mani outli hamlet township abandon fear resid batter bodi parish priest ascens acuna osorio found float balsa river near town emerg vigilant group also known commun polic becom headach guerrero govern author understand resid frustrat note group often wind kidnap suspect fight among prevent polic work truth realli commun forc polic governor hector astudillo said they arm group unfortun carri act gener violenc confront rather help
87,Portugal find a solution to their attacking conundrum: forget the centre-forward,"Reducing a European Championship   to a clash between two individuals seems somehow simplistic yet this tactical battle essentially revolved around how Wales and Portugal used Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Bale was regularly involved in play but Ronaldo proved decisive. On a wider level this was a clash between two teams playing without a traditional   and instead using two natural wingers up front. Hal   and Nani are more accustomed to wide positions but have been outstanding as strike partners for Bale and Ronaldo respectively. Therefore, this was an unusual test for both defences, who theoretically were not battling against sturdy penalty box prowlers but instead were forced to make decisions about how far to track dangerous runs from mobile, speedy attackers drifting across the pitch. For James Collins and Bruno Alves, both immobile, physical   making their first start of the tournament, it was a particular challenge. Bale plays as a No10 in Chris Coleman’s     system, starting behind   but allowed freedom of movement to drift around. Portugal started defensively here and Wales struggled to play penetrative passes into Bale’s feet, so he wandered into much deeper positions, sometimes popping up at left   sometimes collecting short passes into feet from the  . What Bale really wanted, however, was an opportunity to peel away into the channels. Midway through the first half, having started quietly, he suddenly burst into life. When the Portugal   Cédric Soares was dragged up the pitch to close down the Wales    Neil Taylor, Bale instinctively exploited the space before firing a low   cross into the box. Moments later he was dribbling down the opposite flank, tracked by  —   of all people  —   Ronaldo. Then came Bale’s chance to counterattack. Receiving a short ball into his feet in his own   zone, Bale waited for the challenge of Danilo, Portugal’s sole holding midfielder, before majestically turning past him, driving 70 yards with the ball, before hitting a fairly tame   shot at Rui Patrício. Ronaldo simply was not offered that counterattacking threat. Ronaldo, aside from that surprising moment when he was challenging Bale on the edge of his own box, was much less mobile. Ashley Williams halted his first attempt to run at the Wales defence with a strong early tackle, and from then Portugal’s captain was primarily involved when trying to get on the end of crosses. Coleman would have worried Ronaldo and Nani would use their pace in wide areas to exploit the space on the outside of Wales’s back three  —   instead, they played centrally and Wales coped well. Collins outmuscled Ronaldo to reach a   Soares cross, with Portugal appealing for a penalty, while towards the end of the opening period Adrien Silva created a headed chance for him with a cross from the left. But Portugal’s narrow midfield, with Silva, Renato Sanches and João Mário all playing in a similar zone, meant Portugal were not working combinations down the flanks, meaning they were unable to cross from advanced positions. The crosses were floated, hopeful deliveries from deep. The obvious opportunity to cross from an advanced position, though, was from corners. Five minutes into the second half João Mário rolled a   corner back to Raphaël Guerreiro, whose whipped,   cross found Ronaldo towering over James Chester to head home. Wales had looked so secure defending crosses in open play, yet conceded when able to get themselves organised at a set piece. Portugal doubled their lead with a fortunate goal, Ronaldo’s scuffed shot being diverted into the net by Nani. It hardly owed much to design, yet it was further evidence of Nani’s ability up front: this was his third goal of the tournament. Over the past decade Portugal have regularly turned up for major tournaments with   wingers but no prolific   and suffered from poor finishing at this stage. Here, with Ronaldo heading home and Nani playing poacher, Fernando Santos has found the answer to Portugal’s   problem up front  —   simply do not bother with a  . Coleman and Wales, meanwhile, have overachieved by doing exactly the same.",reduc european championship clash individu seem somehow simplist tactic battl essenti revolv around wale portug use gareth bale cristiano ronaldo bale regularli involv play ronaldo prove decis wider level clash team play without tradit instead use natur winger front nani accustom wide posit outstand strike partner bale ronaldo respect therefor unusu test defenc theoret battl sturdi penalti prowler instead forc make decis track danger run mobil speedi attack drift across pitch jame collin bruno alv immobil physic make first start tournament particular challeng bale play chri coleman system start behind allow freedom movement drift around portug start defens wale struggl play penetr pass bale feet wander much deeper posit sometim pop left sometim collect short pass feet what bale realli want howev opportun peel away channel midway first half start quietli suddenli burst life when portug dric soar drag pitch close wale neil taylor bale instinct exploit space fire cross moment later dribbl opposit flank track peopl ronaldo then came bale chanc counterattack receiv short ball feet zone bale wait challeng danilo portug sole hold midfield majest turn past drive yard ball hit fairli tame shot patr ronaldo simpli offer counterattack threat ronaldo asid surpris moment challeng bale edg much less mobil ashley william halt first attempt wale defenc strong earli tackl portug captain primarili involv tri cross coleman would worri ronaldo nani would pace wide area exploit space outsid wale back three instead play central wale cope well collin outmuscl ronaldo reach soar cross portug appeal penalti toward open period adrien silva creat head chanc cross left portug narrow midfield silva renato sanch play similar zone meant portug work combin flank mean unabl cross advanc posit cross float hope deliveri deep obviou opportun cross advanc posit though corner five minut second half roll corner back rapha guerreiro whose whip cross found ronaldo tower jame chester head home wale look secur defend cross open play conced abl organis piec portug doubl lead fortun goal ronaldo scuf shot divert nani hardli owe much design evid nani abil front third goal tournament over past decad portug regularli turn major tournament winger prolif suffer poor finish stage here ronaldo head home nani play poacher fernando santo found answer portug problem front simpli bother coleman wale meanwhil overachiev exactli
88,Former Wells Fargo workers file $2.6bn class action lawsuit amid quota scandal,"Two former Wells Fargo employees have filed a class action in California seeking $2. 6bn or more for workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or fired. The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in California over the past 10 years, including current employees, focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for not meeting sales quotas. “Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,” said the lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday in California superior court in Los Angeles County.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5, 300 employees for opening as many as 2m accounts in customers’ names without authorization from those customers. On 8 September, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a Los Angeles prosecutor announced a $185m settlement with the bank.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo’s reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being conservative in contrast with its rivals. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime and penalties under California law.  Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per day, required progress reports several times daily and reprimanded workers who fell short.  Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests and were counselled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit says.  While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the blame landed on thousands of $   employees who tried to meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to do so, the lawsuit said.  Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages and benefits and facing anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment, the lawsuit said.  Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened, unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of unethical business practices, the lawsuit said.  “Wells Fargo knew that their unreasonable quotas were driving these unethical behaviors that were used to fraudulently increase their stock price and benefit the CEO at the expense of the low level employees,” the lawsuit said.

89,Kicking the habit: two former nuns married in civil ceremony in Italy,"Federica and Isabel’s love story was not that unusual, apart from one detail. The affair, which culminated in a civil union this week in the Italian town of Pinerolo, began “slowly” according to their friend, Franco Barbero. The two had a lot in common, having both decided to devote their lives to charitable work. They fell in love working at a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts, but there was just one hitch. Both were already married to the Catholic church. Federica and Isabel were Franciscan nuns when they met and fell in love, and have both since renounced their vocation and spoken out against the church’s position against homosexuality. “God wants people happy, to live the love in the light of the sun,” Isabel recently told La Stampa, the Italian daily newspaper. The two brides said that they have not lost their faith and would not otherwise have wanted to leave the church. “We call upon our church to welcome all people who love each other,” added Federica, her new bride. The courtship and civil union comes about one year after a Vatican official, Krzysztof Charamsa, publicly abandoned the church after announcing that he was gay and in love. Charamsa was sacked and defrocked after admitting he was in love with another man. The two women were joined in a civil union in a ceremony behind closed doors in Pinerolo’s city hall, about 24 hours before they had planned. The ceremony was supposed to take place on Thursday, but the time was changed after the media were alerted to the story and the couple wanted to avoid a media frenzy. Luca Salvai, the Five Star Movement mayor who performed the ceremony, told La Stampa: “We have guaranteed the right to privacy for this couple, who asked for discretion. ” He added that the couple were expected to remain in Pinerolo, which is near the city of Turin. “Yesterday morning they arrived by themselves, scared by all the clamor, and after the ceremony they left by themselves in silence, one next to the other,” Salvai said. It was the second same sex civil union ceremony performed in the town of Pinerolo since Italy passed legislation to legalise   unions earlier this year. The couple are also due to participate in a religious service by their friend, Barbero, a former priest who was suspended because of his support of gay marriage. “I can assure you that not all [of the other nuns] were against this. They have been criticised, but also understood by some sisters. Just as there are many good priests who do not condemn these kind of choices. I must add, for the record, that it is not the first time that I happen to marry two sisters,” he said.",federica isabel love stori unusu apart detail affair culmin civil union week italian town pinerolo began slowli accord friend franco barbero common decid devot live charit work they fell love work rehabilit centr drug addict hitch both alreadi marri cathol church federica isabel franciscan nun fell love sinc renounc vocat spoken church posit homosexu want peopl happi live love light isabel recent told stampa italian daili newspap bride said lost faith would otherwis want leav church call upon church welcom peopl love ad federica bride courtship civil union come year vatican offici krzysztof charamsa publicli abandon church announc love charamsa sack defrock admit love anoth women join civil union ceremoni behind close door pinerolo citi hall hour plan ceremoni suppos take place thursday time chang media alert stori coupl want avoid media frenzi luca salvai five star movement mayor perform ceremoni told stampa guarante right privaci coupl ask discret ad coupl expect remain pinerolo near citi turin yesterday morn arriv scare clamor ceremoni left silenc next salvai said second civil union ceremoni perform town pinerolo sinc itali pass legisl legalis union earlier year coupl also particip religi servic friend barbero former priest suspend support marriag assur nun they criticis also understood sister just mani good priest condemn kind choic must record first time happen marri sister said
90,Rio 2016: Olympic boxing tournament hit by corruption allegations,"Senior figures within amateur boxing have warned many bouts, including those to decide medals, could be fixed at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro amid widespread concern about corruption and financial malpractice at the sport’s global governing body, the Guardian can reveal. Horrified senior officials within the sport believe a cabal of officials are able to use their power to manipulate the draw and the judging system to ensure certain boxers will win. One senior figure said there was “no doubt” some of the judges and referees in Rio “will be corrupted”. He alleged a group of referees get together before major championships to decide how to score certain bouts. Almost every recent Olympics has featured controversy. Most infamously, at the 1988 Games in Seoul the home favourite Park   beat the American Roy Jones Jr in a light middleweight contest the judging of which became a byword for scandal. The Romanian former International Boxing Association (AIBA)   Rudel Obreja alleged manipulation of the judges’ draw at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. This week he alleged to the Guardian that he was forced out of the governing body as a result. Before the London 2012 Games, it was alleged by the BBC that Azerbaijan, which loaned $10m to AIBA to underwrite a professional boxing series that has not been repaid, had effectively bought medals. A thorough AIBA investigation by senior officials rejected the allegations. An AIBA spokesman this week told the Guardian: “Since June 2015, AIBA has undertaken major governance changes ensuring the   development of our sport according to the requirements of our business and sport partners and for the benefits of the AIBA worldwide community. ” But the senior officials who have spoken to the Guardian, who wish to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against them or boxers from their country, have said the alleged corruption has become more sophisticated and more widespread since the London Games. It is alleged corrupt officials, directed to score bouts in a certain way for a variety of reasons, are said to have initially relied on hand or head signals to manipulate judges at the end of each round so they knew from which corner to select the winner. But after being challenged at a number of major championships they are said to have changed their system, no longer relying on signals but meeting before major championships to decide on certain bouts. “This is all being done very quietly,” said one senior source. “Some bouts are so bloody blatant it’s obvious. It sickens me to my stomach. ” A spokesman for AIBA said its mission was “to ensure the organisation of fair and transparent competitions”. He added: “It is not a matter for AIBA to interfere with the decision made by the judges under sporting rules. ” AIBA said there were approximately 300 judges rated three star and above who were used at elite competitions on a regular basis. It said its certification system ensured all referees and judges “have the highest levels of officiating and are in an optimal situation to perform accordingly”. Sources alleged that at major championships the draw commission was also being directed as to which judges should officiate each bout. AIBA says the draw is operated externally by Swiss Timing, their official scoring partner. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Swiss Timing. In some championships, sources claimed that around half of the bouts could be predetermined. One boxing judge who was prepared to go on the record, Ireland’s Seamus Kelly, told the Guardian he had been asked to cheat at the Arab Games in Doha in 2011 by indicating who was winning during the fight. He claimed a fellow judge had confided there were signals used under the new,   “ ” scoring system at the European Championships in Minsk in 2013. Kelly emailed Dr CK Wu, the sometimes controversial AIBA president, in April 2015 to raise the alarm. Dr Wu replied: “AIBA will immediately investigate this case. We are zero tolerance for this kind of cheating judges. ” Kelly heard nothing further and believes he has been sidelined. “It was mental abuse. I wasn’t sleeping at all because of the way they made me feel. It put an X against my name. They were pushing me away,” Kelly said. “People are afraid to speak out because if they are judges they will be sidelined and won’t get to go to the Olympics or other championships. If they are officials, they fear their country’s boxers will be targeted. ” AIBA said Kelly had been sent home from the youth world championships in 2014 for displaying aggressive behaviour towards one of his colleagues. Though he had since apologised, AIBA said due to the gravity of his actions and “personal issues” it was decided he was not fit to officiate. “Mr Kelly’s allegations are baseless and damaging to our sport,” the spokesman said. “His correspondence to us over the last two years has been erratic, bordering on extortion at times, and once he understood he would not reintegrate into AIBA despite numerous emails, he has decided to launch false accusations against our organisation. ” Kelly disputes AIBA’s version of events. Another   source, who said he believed the manipulation was directed from the heart of the AIBA administration, claimed he witnessed scores being manipulated at major championships and says he is desperately concerned about what is likely to happen at the Rio Olympics. Judges who make these claims are said to have been pressured to stay silent, while others are concerned they will be overlooked for championships and the Olympics if they speak out. AIBA responded: “Boxing is a sport which triggers a lot of passion and sometimes people tend to behave as fans and not as boxing experts, which is prejudicial to the reputation of our sport. As for any Olympic Games, the expectations are very high and we can understand the importance of winning a medal. “However, our role is to ensure a fair and transparent competition and that the thousands of spectators and millions of fans enjoy an amazing tournament with 13 great and undisputed gold medallists. We reiterate that, unless tangible proof is put forward, not just rumours, we cannot further comment on these allegations. ” The spokesman for the governing body added: “We will continue to use any means, including legal action, to protect our sport and its RJ [refereeing and judging] community whose integrity is constantly put into question despite their commitment and expertise. The future of AIBA boxing is bright and the organisation will not be deterred by subjective judgments made by discontented parties which do not reflect the AIBA community as a whole. ” Sources alleged scores are being manipulated to reward countries prepared to pay to host AIBA championships. The international governing body has been accused of haemorrhaging cash since accepting a $10m loan from Azerbaijan to underwrite the expansion of WSB and AIBA Professional Boxing, a competition launched in 2014 to give professional boxers a “pathway” to qualify for Rio. In a memo sent by ousted director general Ho Kim in June 2015 to AIBA executive committee members, seen by the Guardian, he underlines its “precarious financial situation” and the “rapidly expanding budget” of Wu’s presidential office in Taipei. He also alleges Wu’s failed 2013 campaign to become the IOC president was covered out of AIBA funds, a claim AIBA denies on behalf of itself and Wu. Of the Azerbaijan loan, Kim called on the executive committee to “properly understand what are Azerbaijan’s expectations as to the repayment of the loan or what other benefits are expected if the loan cannot be repaid”. The AIBA spokesman said it was “in the process” of repaying the Azerbaijan loan but that it could not go into detail because of confidentiality clauses. In a series of articles on the website Fight News, the Bulgarian journalist Ognian Georgiev last month made a series of detailed allegations about apparently suspect officiating at the Olympic qualifiers in the Venezuelan state of Vargas and the way in which judges were allocated to particular bouts. Another senior boxing official claimed to the Guardian: “Simply because it costs so much to run a tournament, some countries are putting their hands out. You could interpret it in that way  —   look at Venezuela. Looking at the evidence, you have to wonder. ” The South American country is believed to have paid around $450, 000 to host the Olympic qualifying tournament from which four of their six boxers who competed qualified for Rio. Critics say countries who have hosted AIBA championships over recent years appear to have a correspondingly high proportion of boxers who qualify for the Games. The AIBA spokesman responded: “The host city of Vargas was selected by a bidding process and a host fee was paid as is usually the case for all sports events organisation across the world. ” “We do not want to comment on rumours,” Wu told Georgiev. “Approximately 60 matches took place during the   Olympic qualification tournament and all participants including the boxers praised the quality and fairness of the event. ” Terry Smith, a Welshman who sits on the AIBA executive committee and is the honorary life chairman of the referees and judges committee, insisted he had not heard any allegations of malpractice. “I haven’t heard anyone speak like this. If it’s the case, the sooner someone alerts the president, the better. He is in the position to do something about it,” he told the Guardian. “I wish they’d confide a little bit internally. I would like them to challenge it where it takes place. It would be more helpful for us. You can be sitting right in the middle of something and not see it go on,” Smith added. “These are the types of rumours we certainly don’t want with the Olympics coming up. With that many contests going on there is bound to be one that becomes controversial, the last thing you want to know is something like this throwing it into doubt. ”",senior figur within amateur box

91,"Mail Online sex attack story ’filled with lies’, Swedish woman says","A Swedish woman has accused the Mail Online of falsely representing her as the victim of a sexual assault in an article about sex attacks allegedly perpetrated by “foreign youths” at a music festival. Lisen Andréasson Florman told the Guardian she was shocked to discover herself cast as the victim of an assault, and said she felt “violated” by the Mail Online report. The article had contained extensive quotes from Andréasson Florman describing a sexual attack at the hands of a group of men, who groped her breasts and left her feeling “small and vulnerable”. “No one groped my breasts, despite what the Daily Mail claims in both headline and story. The Daily Mail has published a piece of sensationalistic writing, filled with lies. The newspaper has consciously distorted my quotes, stolen private photos and lied. All in order to confirm a story that serves an agenda that isn’t mine and to tell a story that isn’t true,” she wrote in a Facebook post.  Her quotes came in a piece that began: “Five women say they were raped at Sweden’s biggest music festival  —   on the same weekend as a mob of ‘foreign youths’ sexually assaulted 35 females, one as young as 12 at another concert. ” The online headline, published next to a picture of her, reproduces a quote, stating: “‘I asked them to stop. .. but they grabbed my breasts very roughly’: Second Swedish music festival victim reveals she was groped by a mob of men as police reveal five more women were raped. ” The quotes were reprinted in the Sun and the Daily Star in the context of a number of reports about an upsurge in sexual violence at the hands of foreign men in Sweden. After contacting the Mail Online, the article was amended and her quotes were removed. She has received no apology from the organisation. The misreported quotes remain on the Sun and the Star websites. Andréasson Florman, who is the founder of a charity, Night Shift, which sends volunteers to festivals and nightclubs to work against violence and sexual assault, said in a telephone call to the Guardian that she had been surrounded by a group of men at the Bråvalla festival. She said she felt intimidated by the men, but she was clear that they were protesting at her professional presence at the festival as a campaigner against violence. “They grabbed me and reached for my radio, but they never roughly grabbed my breast,” she said. She said she told the Mail Online journalist that the men who surrounded her were Swedish.  She was interviewed by the Mail Online a few days after the festival, and gave a   interview about sexual harassment at music events. She said she regretted failing to have read previous articles by the Mail Online freelance journalist Ulf Andersson before agreeing to speak to him. She now believes that some of his earlier reporting appeared to “promote an   or xenophobic angle”.  “The attacks on the festival are of great significance politically in Sweden. We are seeing how   politicians are using these incidents to promote   sentiments in our society,” she said, adding that her organisation sees “no connection between the refugee influx or immigrants and the occurrence of sexual harassment or assault in Swedish nightlife”. “We have noticed an apparent increase in organised assaults where several men cooperate in surrounding and groping girls. It’s not  —   contrary to what you hear some people say in the public debate  —   linked to certain ethnicity, background or religion. Not in our experience, and we spend hours and hours in the field. The only common denominator is that the perpetrators we’ve come across are all men. ” A series of articles about attacks by foreign youths at Swedish music festivals has been published by the Mail Online this month. The subject has become highly politicised in Sweden in the wake of the unease about sex assaults in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. After reports of attacks at the Puttei Parken festival, police quickly attributed the crimes to “foreign youths” in a statement on the Värmland regional police website. The statement was later removed after doubt was cast on whether the attackers had been Swedish or from elsewhere. Earlier this year, the Swedish embassy in London was reported to have sent a dispatch to the Swedish foreign ministry expressing concern that the Daily Mail was running a campaign against Sweden’s refugee policy. “The tabloid Daily Mail has launched a campaign against Swedish migration policy,” the message said, according to Swedish media. “Sweden is being used as a deterrent and an argument against allowing more refugees into the UK. ”  The Swedish embassy said they had no comment when contacted. The Mail Online did not respond to a request for comment.  Andréasson Florman said Night Shift was a “  organisation, which takes a clear stand against racism and sexism” and she was angry that her words had been “misused and misrepresented by media outlets and people who seem to have another agenda which is highly political”.  She was also angry that the reports were illustrated with pictures from her Facebook, reproduced without her permission. “Of course I am angry when my organisation’s work and my own person is misrepresented. It does not help the struggle against violence and sexual assault by construing facts for political gain,” she said.",swedish woman accus mail onlin fals repres victim sexual assault articl attack allegedli perpetr foreign youth music festiv lisen andr asson florman told guardian shock discov cast victim assault said felt violat mail onlin report articl contain extens quot andr asson florman describ sexual attack hand group grope breast left feel small vulner grope breast despit daili mail claim headlin stori daili mail publish piec sensationalist write fill lie newspap conscious distort quot stolen privat photo lie order confirm stori serv agenda mine tell stori true wrote facebook post quot came piec began five women rape sweden biggest music festiv weekend foreign youth sexual assault femal young anoth concert onlin headlin publish next pictur reproduc quot state ask stop grab breast roughli second swedish music festiv victim reveal grope polic reveal five women rape quot reprint daili star context number report upsurg sexual violenc hand foreign sweden after contact mail onlin articl amend quot remov receiv apolog organis misreport quot remain star websit andr asson florman founder chariti night shift send volunt festiv nightclub work violenc sexual assault said telephon call guardian surround group valla festiv said felt intimid clear protest profession presenc festiv campaign violenc they grab reach radio never roughli grab breast said said told mail onlin journalist surround swedish interview mail onlin day festiv gave interview sexual harass music event said regret fail read previou articl mail onlin freelanc journalist andersson agre speak believ earlier report appear promot xenophob angl attack festiv great signific polit sweden see politician use incid promot sentiment societi said ad organis see connect refuge influx immigr occurr sexual harass assault swedish nightlif notic appar increas organis assault sever cooper surround grope girl contrari hear peopl public debat link certain ethnic background religion experi spend hour hour field common denomin perpetr come across seri articl attack foreign youth swedish music festiv publish mail onlin month subject becom highli politicis sweden wake uneas assault cologn year after report attack puttei parken festiv polic quickli attribut crime foreign youth statement rmland region polic websit statement later remov doubt cast whether attack swedish elsewher earlier year swedish embassi london report sent dispatch swedish foreign ministri express concern daili mail run campaign sweden refuge polici tabloid daili mail launch campaign swedish migrat polici messag said accord swedish media sweden use deterr argument allow refuge swedish embassi said comment contact mail onlin respond request comment andr asson florman said night shift organis take clear stand racism sexism angri word misus misrepres media outlet peopl seem anoth agenda highli polit also angri report illustr pictur facebook reproduc without permiss cours angri organis work person misrepres help struggl violenc sexual assault constru fact polit gain said
92,England and penalties: 20 years of hurt that could continue against Iceland,"Stefan Kuntz remembers the moment well. He says the Euro 96   between England and Germany at Wembley was the highlight of his career. The   anniversary of the game was on Sunday, and it’s fair to say the repercussions of the result have been   for England than for Germany. The game had finished   and it went to a penalty shootout. Kuntz had asked the coach, Berti Vogts, to put him fifth in the list of   for one specific reason: he was hoping that the shootout would be over by the time it came round to him. Kuntz was only playing because Jürgen Klinsmann had been injured in a     against Croatia. But he had scored Germany’s equaliser against England and had an   header ruled out for a foul. “Never a foul,” he says. As he watched England score all five of their penalties, he became angry. “It was terrible for me. I was fifth because I never wanted to take one, and when it came to it, my penalty was the most important of all. During that walk, you are so alone, so afraid. I had to find a way to conquer my nerves. So I made myself angry. That way, I forgot about the nerves. ” Kuntz thought about his children, who were then five and seven, and how their   would tease them if he missed the penalty. “I got so angry at the thought of these clowns upsetting my kids. I thought: ‘Don’t do this to your family! ’” Kuntz,   hit Germany’s best penalty, high to his natural side. He was so wound up that afterwards he forgot to smile. Just a deep breath as he returned to the  . It was  . Sudden death. Next up was Gareth Southgate, whose weak shot was saved by Andreas Köpke. Andreas Möller scored the winning penalty (even though the Germans had still not decided who would take that penalty until Southgate missed at that point, Möller ran forward before anyone could object). England lost the match. More significantly, it was the moment that England’s psychological issue with penalty shootouts took seed. The trauma of this defeat was far greater than in 1990, when West Germany beat them in the World Cup   on penalties. This time around, England were the home nation, it was Germany, and on penalties, again. The press had been full of military metaphors  —   The Mirror’s “Achtung Surrender!” headline before the game took it too far and as a result, team sponsors Vauxhall pulled their advertising from the paper  —   but once again, England had fallen short. “There was additional pressure because of the meaning of the game, the fact that it was against Germany. We knew that the media had turned this game into a war but for us it was never like that,” Kuntz says. “Look, even our parents were not involved in the war, it was two generations away from us, so we did not understand the headlines. It would have been more helpful for the England team if it was not about war or history, but if they just concentrated on football. I think the media built up this game too much and that added to the pressure for the players. ” It was England’s great misfortune that they had to endure another shootout defeat so soon after, at the 1998 World Cup, against another nation with whom the country had a complicated sporting and political history: Argentina. England lost that one, too. So by the time they faced Portugal in Euro 2004  —   and, surprise, surprise, lost again  —   there was already a   complex about penalty shootouts. Would this complex exist if England had lost to another nation on penalties in 1996? Switzerland, say? Or the Czech Republic? Alex Gordon is a professional semiotician and chief executive of Sign Salad, a cultural insight agency that looks for meaning in everyday events and symbols. “It’s clear to me that international football is the   replacement for battle,” Gordon says. “We see that not just with the language used in football reporting  —   “from the camp” “gaining territory” that kind of thing  —   but also with national anthems and exchanging of pennants before matches. “A penalty shootout is critical to the way a nation views itself. Its whole cultural narrative is being written as it takes place, and the national myth is being reinforced or transformed. In England’s case, it absolutely matters because every loss on penalties is a reminder of our loss of Empire the penalty defeat is about the loss of our global status. ” Gordon also links the clarity and simplicity of the penalty’s    combat, especially in today’s social     landscape, to a romantic appeal that can be traced back to Hector, Lancelot and Robin Hood. “Historically the duel is about chivalry and romance, all of which are true of the penalty,” Gordon says. “There’s the respect of waiting till your opponent is ready the romantic stories of penalty heroes and villains. And masculinity plays a huge role only the brave take a penalty, but missing one is like losing your  . Like the lion who loses a fight and is banished from his pride: this is about the essential structure of the human and animal tribal system. ” England have not won a shootout in the 20 years since that dramatic summer’s night at Wembley. Their last two European Championship knockout matches have ended the same way: with shootout defeats, by Italy (2012) and Portugal (2004). As Roy Hodgson’s team prepare to face Iceland on Monday, and a possible   against France, the spectre of   looms large. Kuntz has some advice, even if it does come 20 years too late: “Sometimes when you’re at home, you can feel the doubt of your own fans. I wonder if Southgate thought: ‘Even the fans don’t think I will score this,’” he said. “What is in your mind is often what will happen, and controlling your mentality is a huge part of the game. ” This is an edited extract from the updated paperback version of Ben Lyttleton’s book Twelve Yards: The Art  Psychology of the Perfect Penalty (Bantam Press)",stefan kuntz rememb moment well say euro england germani wembley highlight career anniversari game sunday fair repercuss result england germani game finish went penalti shootout kuntz ask coach berti vogt fifth list specif reason hope shootout would time came round kuntz play rgen klinsmann injur croatia score germani equalis england header rule foul never foul say watch england score five penalti becam angri terribl fifth never want take came penalti import dure walk alon afraid find conquer nerv made angri that forgot nerv kuntz thought children five seven would teas miss penalti angri thought clown upset kid thought famili kuntz germani best penalti high natur side wound afterward forgot smile just deep breath return sudden death next gareth southgat whose weak shot save andrea andrea ller score win penalti even though german still decid would take penalti southgat miss point ller forward anyon could object england lost match more significantli moment england psycholog issu penalti shootout took seed trauma defeat greater west germani beat world penalti thi time around england home nation germani penalti press full militari metaphor mirror achtung surrend headlin game took result team sponsor vauxhal pull advertis paper england fallen short there addit pressur mean game fact germani knew media turn game never like kuntz say look even parent involv gener away understand headlin would help england team histori concentr footbal think media built game much ad pressur player england great misfortun endur anoth shootout defeat soon world anoth nation countri complic sport polit histori argentina england lost time face portug euro surpris surpris lost alreadi complex penalti shootout would complex exist england lost anoth nation penalti switzerland czech republ alex gordon profession semiotician chief execut sign salad cultur insight agenc look mean everyday event symbol clear intern footbal replac battl gordon say languag use footbal report camp gain territori kind thing also nation anthem exchang pennant match penalti shootout critic nation view whole cultur narr written take place nation myth reinforc transform england case absolut matter everi loss penalti remind loss empir penalti defeat loss global statu gordon also link clariti simplic penalti combat especi today social landscap romant appeal trace back hector lancelot robin hood histor duel chivalri romanc true penalti gordon say there respect wait till oppon readi romant stori penalti hero villain masculin play huge role brave take penalti miss like lose like lion lose fight banish pride essenti structur human anim tribal system england shootout year sinc dramat summer night wembley their last european championship knockout match end shootout defeat itali portug hodgson team prepar face iceland monday possibl franc spectr loom larg kuntz advic even come year late sometim home feel doubt fan wonder southgat thought even fan think score said what mind often happen control mental huge part game thi edit extract updat paperback version lyttleton book twelv yard psycholog perfect penalti bantam press
93,The Voice: five things we learned from the season 11 preview,"After NBC’s coverage of the Olympic closing ceremony from Rio, viewers were treated to an additional heaping helping of musical numbers and awkward commentary thanks to a preview of the upcoming season of the talent search stalwart with those revolving chairs aka The Voice. Revamped for an American   television landscape, the latest iteration features veteran judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, along with newcomers Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys. Here are five takeaways of what we’re in store for this upcoming season. Blatantly fake “tension” between judges has always been a   storyline for producers looking to fill airtime and spur watercolor conversation. Fortunately for new judges Cyrus and Keys, the responsibility of creating “drama” will largely fall on the shoulders of Adam Levine and Blake Shelton. It’s a refreshing break from the “diva” dustups which have been the stock option when it comes to talent shows looking for headline grabbing “fallouts”. While none of the judges are ever Simon Cowell levels of tough, it seems Keys will take the role of a nice, supportive member of the panel, especially considering her reaction on Sunday night to    We McDonald, who delivered a rousing rendition of Nina Simone’s classic Feeling Good. While Levine sat   Keys looked on like a proud mom and jumped out of her seat, which is a classic move from the “nice” judge. When it came time to offer some criticism, Keys called McDonald both “beautiful” and “perfect”. While Cyrus was almost as nice as Keys, one thing that’s apparent is that she’s still going to provide the most   moments. Judging by a denim jacket adorned with monstrously oversized flowers, her clothes might do a lot of the talking but you can still expect moments like when she hopped up on stage as a contestant was getting critiqued to belt out a random acapella version of Dolly Parton’s Jolene. (For her part, Keys followed that up with an equally random acapella performance of her hit, No One.) So tune in if you like acapella  . The television landscape is a much different place from when The Voice premiered in 2011. Back then, viral internet moments were hapless accidents, as opposed to today when they’re both manufactured and something any show seeking relevance desperately needs to survive. (One of the reasons cited as to why Comedy Central’s Nightly Show was axed was a lack of social media interaction.) Luckily, with Keys, Cyrus, Levine and Shelton, The Voice’s new season is bound to be chock full of shareable moments, starting with the preview episode’s epic, outdoor performance of Aerosmith’s Dream On sung by the judges. It was a moment that was instantly passed around Twitter for forensic analysis and universal mocking.  Much like any other reality TV completion series, NBC is well aware that it’s only a matter of time before The Voice loses steam. Sure, American Idol petered out first, but that’s because Idol began a full 10 years before The Voice. Once fighting for its spot in a crowded landscape, the series is now a lone wolf when it comes to major singing competitions, and its clock is ticking as well. That’s part of the reason why executives thought to revamp the proceedings in the first place, though no amount of rearranging will seal its fate as the competition trend continues to fade and future seasons of The Voice roll on.

94,What makes Novak Djokovic the perfect tennis player – and so hard to beat?,"“It’s particularly the backhand return,” says Craig O’Shannessy, the strategy analyst for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the ATP and WTA Tours. “It’s the best backhand return in the world. That’s where it all starts. Most serves are directed to the backhand. It’s just really the simplicity of his technique. Two hands on the grip, his upper body rotates 90 degrees sideways and that’s it. O’Shannessy points out that Novak Djokovic rarely goes for broke on the return. “The big target area is deep right down the middle of the court. He’s trying to negate the impact of the serve. The server (usually) has an extra two shots off the serve where the serve still has influence, a halo effect. If you’re serving, you never want to hit a fourth shot because then you’re into an even   battle where the serve is irrelevant. Djokovic, with that return, the server is lucky if they get one extra shot. Sometimes they’re actually on defence on the very first ball after the serve. Then he has great court position. It’s huge percentages. Djokovic will hurt you everywhere, he doesn’t hit so many return winners  —   at Wimbledon in 2015 he only hit 11  —   but he gets so many returns back into play. ” “The biggest thing is his ability to hit a spot,” O’Shannessy says. “If I was to put an empty can of balls on the court and you pick one player to hit a spot, typically it would have been Roger Federer. Today, coming into Wimbledon, I think Djokovic is that guy. Particularly the corners. He doesn’t serve a ton into the body but he serves a lot of sliders out wide in the deuce court, the patterns are like Federer, when he needs a point he will serve more out wide in the deuce court when he has a bit of leeway he will go more down the T. In the ad court he mixes things very evenly. He has cleaned up his motion, the toss is ridiculous, it’s in the same spot every time. It’s not the hardest serve  —   in 2015, his average for the tournament was 117mph on first serve, 97 on the second serve and his fastest was 127. He puts a little topspin on it, there’s a little slice on it, in the ad court down the T especially, there’s a little more topspin on the ad out wide just to cover it and improve those percentages a little bit. His first serve percentage is 66. 6% for the last 52 weeks, which puts him third on the Tour only Rafael Nadal and John Isner are higher. “When we think of players, we think of them in terms of styles,” O’Shannessy says. “David Ferrer’s a grinder, Lleyton Hewitt’s a   and Federer’s an all‑court player etc. But every player on the planet is a first‑strike player  —   the points exist in the   shot range. Seventy per cent of all points finish in the first four shots, 20% are in the five to eight shot range and 10% are nine shots plus. Djokovic is right at that average. In the 2015 Australian Open, 69% of all points he played were nought to four 21 were in the five to eight range and only 10% were in nine plus. We think of him playing all these long points and grinding. But again, in the 2015 Australian Open, in the   range, he only won 13 more points than he lost. He was plus 48 in five to eight and he was plus 89 in nought to four. He’s not the animal we think he is. When the points are longer, he runs, he’s elastic and his defence is fine but by far the majority of points he collects are in nought to four because of his ability to hit spots on serve  —   and particularly his amazing points. His advantage is much more in the nought to four than it is in the nine plus. ” Henri Leconte, the former France Davis Cup player, believes Djokovic is as dominant now as Federer and Nadal were in their pomp. “He is the one and only for the moment,” says Leconte, who will be commentating for Eurosport during Wimbledon. “After winning the Davis Cup against France in 2010 he’s definitely found a way to concentrate himself and be ready for the big tournaments and grand slam play, as he is doing now. ” Leconte says Djokovic’s tough upbringing, in   Serbia, played a part in his mental strength. “Definitely, life has been hard and complicated for him and as a family,” Leconte says. “Definitely, I think that he went through a lot of terrible things, so now he can enjoy life. For him, if he wins it’s very important, if he loses it’s not the end of the world. He is happy in his life, he knows his body really well, mentally he can also produce and be more relaxed. When you are winning everything, when you are on top of your game and you’re the No1, you just enjoy yourself, you know what to do. ” “Djokovic’s fitness is the best in the world,” Leconte says. “The way he practises, he has a new technique, he is more flexible than anyone else. Before we used to say you need muscles, you need power it’s not the case any more, you have to be fit, you have to be able to react as well, be light, be flexible, you have to be many things. I haven’t seen anyone as flexible as him  —   maybe Plastic Man. I think the most important thing to be now is to be flexible, to have the ligaments and joints flexible, too. Be capable of training as hard as possible, not losing power and be flexible. When I watch him slide, I just think I would break myself. He is capable of doing it. He is unbelievable. ”",particularli backhand return say craig shannessi strategi analyst wimbledon australian open tour best backhand return world that start most serv direct backhand realli simplic techniqu hand grip upper bodi rotat degre sideway shannessi point novak djokov rare goe broke return target area deep right middl court tri negat impact serv server usual extra shot serv serv still influenc halo effect serv never want fourth shot even battl serv irrelev djokov return server lucki extra shot sometim actual defenc first ball serv then great court posit huge percentag djokov hurt everywher mani return winner wimbledon get mani return back play biggest thing abil spot shannessi say empti ball court pick player spot typic would roger feder today come wimbledon think djokov particularli corner serv bodi serv slider wide deuc court pattern like feder need point serv wide deuc court leeway court mix thing evenli clean motion toss ridicul spot everi time hardest serv averag tournament first serv second serv fastest put littl topspin littl slice court especi littl topspin wide cover improv percentag littl first serv percentag last week put third tour rafael nadal john isner higher when think player think term style shannessi say david ferrer grinder lleyton hewitt feder court player everi player planet first strike player point exist shot rang seventi cent point finish first four shot five eight shot rang nine shot plu djokov right averag australian open point play nought four five eight rang nine plu think play long point grind australian open rang point lost plu five eight plu nought four anim think when point longer run elast defenc fine major point collect nought four abil spot serv particularli amaz point advantag much nought four nine plu henri lecont former franc davi player believ djokov domin feder nadal pomp moment say lecont comment eurosport wimbledon after win davi franc definit found concentr readi tournament grand slam play lecont say djokov tough upbring serbia play part mental strength definit life hard complic famili lecont say definit think went terribl thing enjoy life win import lose world happi life know bodi realli well mental also produc relax when win everyth game enjoy know djokov fit best world lecont say practis techniqu flexibl anyon els befor use need muscl need power case abl react well light flexibl mani thing seen anyon flexibl mayb plastic think import thing flexibl ligament joint flexibl capabl train hard possibl lose power flexibl when watch slide think would break capabl unbeliev
95,"13th review – Ava DuVernay’s angry, persuasive film about the jailing of black men","Ava DuVernay, director of the Martin Luther King drama Selma, has made a fiercely radical documentary for Netflix in sympathy with the Black Lives Matter movement. Her film argues that America’s incarceration of black men is a phenomenon with its roots in slavery, and that the resemblances are not minor or ironic echoes but symptoms of the same structural cause. Ironically, it is about the 13th constitutional amendment, which abolished slavery and the state’s right to deprive a person of liberty but with the specific exception of “criminals” thus forging a link in the judicial mindset between imprisonment and slavery. It is an attitude that persists into the Jim Crow era, the   wars on crime and drugs, the Clinton   rule   …     and beyond. The state’s punitive energies were always targeted at the poorest, the least able to pay bail, the likeliest to be involved in crime and the most liable to have their protest criminalised. It’s like taking the Matrix red pill when you listen to statements from Nixon aide John Ehrlichman and Reagan consigliere Lee Atwater making it clear that attacks on “drugs” and “crime” are euphemisms for race. And with private firms running jails and lobbying Washington, black males have become raw material for a corporate legal industry.

96,Zsa Zsa Gabor dies aged 99,"The actor and celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor has died aged 99. The Hollywood star, arguably more famous for her larger than life personality and string of marriages than for her films, passed away at her home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Her husband, Frederic von Anhalt, said she died of a heart attack. “We tried everything, but her heart just stopped and that was it,” he said. “Even the ambulance tried very hard to get her back, but there was no way. ” Gabor suffered a series of illnesses in recent years and had to have her leg partially amputated in January due to poor circulation. She suffered a stroke in 2005, three years after a car accident had left her partially paralysed.  In 2010 she reportedly asked a priest to administer the last rites after surgery to remove two blood clots the following year she had a leg amputated. The last stage of her life was reported to have been spent suffering from dementia. This spell of   was said to have begun after she was sent to hospital suffering from grief and anxiety over the death of Elizabeth Taylor in March 2011. Her then publicist John Blanchette (who died in 2014) revealed that Gabor suffered dangerously high blood pressure watching TV coverage of the news of Taylor’s death, saying: “Oh, Jane Russell and Liz Taylor  —   I’m next. ” Although many of the details of her early life are disputed, Gabor is believed to have been born on 6 February 1917 as Sari Gabor in Budapest, Hungary, where she was brought up with her older and younger sisters, Magda and Eva. She acted on stage in Vienna in her youth before emigrating to the United States in 1941. Her first starring role was in Moulin Rouge (1952) directed by John Huston. She attained cult figure status starring in 1950s   including Queen of Outer Space, in which she played a rebel Venusian who falls in love with four Earthmen whom her   queen wants to destroy. Later, she maintained her profile with film and TV cameos. She made one such appearance in The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991) featuring in a scene that appeared to make fun of her   conviction for slapping a police officer in a traffic incident. She appeared in dozens of films, but these achievements were arguably overshadowed later on by public interest in her extravagant style and fondness for wealthy husbands. She married nine times and her spouses included Conrad Hilton, the founder of the Hilton hotel chain, and Barbie doll creator Jack Ryan. Her last marriage was also her longest lasting: she tied the knot with Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt in 1986.  He has also battled   in recent years, hospitalised twice in 2010, once after swallowing a bee and another time following his gluing his eye shut. He was also involved in a motor accident in 2011 . Gabor’s only child, Francesca Hilton, died aged 67 in February 2015.

The small flicker of hope that we might finally have a female president in the US was thoroughly doused by Donald Trump. Last year two women won a Nobel prize this year there was none. The number of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 dropped. And research announced at the World Economic Forum found that it will take approximately 170 years to close the gender pay gap around the world. One hundred and seventy years. So overall it doesn’t look like 2017 is going to be the year women finally achieve gender parity. In fact, so far the attempts to move us toward it have proved to be, well, a bit  .  The UK government’s attempt to make pay gap reporting mandatory for all companies with more than 250 employees has been met with disgruntled muttering and very little action from business.  A few organisations have made some tentative steps towards it, and those already reporting their gender pay gaps should be applauded, but for most it was just another piece of red tape to be ignored. Much easier to point the finger at women and say it’s our fault for not asking. A great deal is made of the need to encourage women to negotiate more effectively. However, even if we take that into 2017, research suggests it’s not going to help. While women ask for pay rises as often as men do, they’re much less likely to get them. The reality is we expect men to be pushy about salary, to ask for more money and to vocalise their worth, so when they do it we’re not surprised. However, society has taught that it’s not polite for women to do the same, so when they do, we tend to see them as pushy and arrogant, and that instantly makes us less likely to reward them. So while it’s useful to encourage women to negotiate their salary more firmly, it’s also not the only way to solve this problem and certainly won’t help women in the coming year. This doesn’t mean equal pay in 2017 is impossible. We might not be able to achieve it on a worldwide level, but within the UK, the US and Australia it should certainly be achievable.  In 2015, Salesforce did an audit of its pay gap. CEO Marc Benioff was so sure the company wouldn’t have a gender pay gap that he made a deal with his senior female employees. If they could prove there was in fact a pay gap he would instantly fix it.  They proved it and Benioff instantly paid out US$3m (£2. $4. 1m) to fix it. He found every woman who was being paid less than a male colleague doing the same job and adjusted her salary accordingly. In the grand scheme of things $3m is not much to a big corporation like Salesforce, but the amount of goodwill it bought was priceless. There’s absolutely nothing stopping other businesses following suit. And this is the one bright light that has come out of 2016. While it hasn’t been a good year for women’s rights, it has been a great year for women speaking up and making their voices heard. From politics to Hollywood, women around the world have been calling time on the sexist attitudes and experiences they’ve encountered and pushed back against them.  If we can keep doing that in 2017 then maybe, just maybe, we’ll be shouting so loudly that no company would dare to underpay us ever again.

98,How do I tell my daughter that her online ‘truth’ is a conspiracy theory?,"I was having a discussion with one of my children  —   I won’t say which one, but let’s just say she is very much a part of the virtual generation  —   those who get most of their entertainment and information from the internet. The subject turned to, well, possibly global warming, ecology or food pollution. The point was, my daughter had some facts. Or thought she had some facts. The gist was that these   facts, which she’d picked up online, were not only enormous and significant, but were being suppressed by the mainstream media. Everyone knew about these facts but were determined to ignore them, because these facts reflected badly on the government. I pointed out to my daughter that I had some little experience of journalism and the news media, and that such a scenario was excessively unlikely. The idea that the whole news media could collectively shut down a story because it was uncomfortable to the government just didn’t make sense  —   not least because of competition, the search for status and the profit motive. Yes, facts could be suppressed because of libel laws and gagging injunctions  —   but not because of a conspiracy among, say, the editors of the Daily Mail, the Guardian and the Today programme. They all had too little in common and too much to gain by breaking a big story. I waited, like a fool, for her to adjust her opinion. None was forthcoming. Quite the opposite. She became angry with me and in effect accused me of thinking I knew everything. Her conviction that there was an international media conspiracy going on to suppress uncomfortable facts was undiminished. Now, this might mean nothing. Or it might mean a great deal. As it happened, the next day I came across an article in the New York Times entitled “How the internet is loosening our grip on the truth”  —   a very timely exposition of the   society. The author suggests that we exist in smaller and smaller “ ” and can choose to follow sources of information that merely mimic our own views. What is happening seems to be a mass case of arrested development. Children can be remarkably gullible but also absolutely impervious to reality. You can tell them that a man comes down the chimney dressed in a red suit to deliver their Christmas presents and they will happily believe you. On the other hand, you can point out that the moon is not, in fact, made of green cheese, and they will call you an outright liar. This confusion about the truth usually begins to disappear as children grow up and see that there are not only observable facts, but also collectively observable knowledge that is difficult to verify but must nevertheless be taken on trust. The idea that the Earth is (roughly) a sphere and orbits the sun is pretty much universally accepted, but very few know the science that proves it. It is taken as a matter of faith as part of our established store of knowledge. It struck me as I argued with my daughter that the collective store of trusted knowledge is dwindling, despite the   information revolution. Adults, like children, tend towards the irrational, and the internet has become an immense tool for facilitating that tendency. I worry for our children, because they live in a world of decaying trust that they seem powerless to resist. As universities become more about servicing paying customers than teaching critical thinking, and all knowledge takes on the aspect of being an optional individual extra chosen from a range of    opinions, we are condemning ourselves to think like children our whole lives. And as William Golding noted in Lord of the Flies, children, left to their own devices, can be very wicked indeed. @timlottwriter",discuss children much part virtual gener entertain inform internet subject turn well possibl global warm ecolog food pollut point daughter fact thought fact gist fact pick onlin enorm signific suppress mainstream media everyon knew fact determin ignor fact reflect badli govern point daughter littl experi journal news media scenario excess unlik idea whole news media could collect shut stori uncomfort govern make sens least competit search statu profit motiv fact could suppress libel law gag injunct conspiraci among editor daili mail guardian today programm they littl common much gain break stori wait like fool adjust opinion none forthcom quit opposit becam angri effect accus think knew everyth convict intern media conspiraci go suppress uncomfort fact undiminish might mean noth might mean great deal happen next came across articl york time entitl internet loosen grip truth time exposit societi author suggest exist smaller smaller choos follow sourc inform mere mimic view what happen seem mass case arrest develop children remark gullibl also absolut impervi realiti tell come chimney dress suit deliv christma present happili believ hand point moon fact made green chees call outright liar thi confus truth usual begin disappear children grow observ fact also collect observ knowledg difficult verifi must nevertheless taken trust idea earth roughli sphere orbit pretti much univers accept know scienc prove taken matter faith part establish store knowledg struck argu daughter collect store trust knowledg dwindl despit inform revolut adult like children tend toward irrat internet becom immens tool facilit tendenc worri children live world decay trust seem powerless resist univers becom servic pay custom teach critic think knowledg take aspect option individu extra chosen rang opinion condemn think like children whole live william gold note lord fli children left devic wick inde timlottwrit
99,"If Berlusconi is like Trump, what can America learn from Italy?","Among the political figures who congratulated Donald Trump on his surprise election victory was the politician to whom the billionaire real estate mogul and reality television star has most often been compared: Silvio Berlusconi. The rightwing former Italian prime minister and billionaire media mogul, who was dogged by claims that he used an underage prostitute at his infamous “bunga bunga” parties and counted Vladimir Putin as a close ally and friend, said the comparisons between the two were “obvious” and that Trump would rule with “authority and equilibrium”.  If it’s true that Berlusconi and Trump, two showmen who have railed against immigrants, mocked women and targeted press freedom, are indeed cut from the same cloth, it may also be the case that few will understand liberal Americans’ consternation in coming years like the Italians.  Here, then, are some warnings  —   and a few words of advice. For years, Berlusconi’s boorish behaviour was a gift to political opponents and journalists who were free to ridicule him. But ultimately they did not prove an effective opposition. “Berlusconi’s opponents had a very wide and open avenue and they couldn’t resist walking down that avenue. This brought them to a number of defeats. Because when he said: ‘The west is [superior]’ and opponents said: ‘How politically incorrect, white imperialist’ the reality is that a huge part of the Italian voters said in private: ‘He is right,” said Giovanni Orsina, author of Berlusconism and Italy, an exploration of how Berlusconi held on to power. Opposing Berlusconi by ridiculing him, Orsina said, was a way to preach to the converted, as were attempts to warn that Berlusconi’s rule represented the end of Italian democracy. “The most powerful way to oppose him, but it was never really done seriously, was to try and understand what his voters want and try to address the need of his voters. No jokes, stop shouting, stop crying, stop saying: ‘It is a horror and disaster’ try and seriously understand what his voters want, and the left was never really successful in doing that,” Orsina said. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the media, having promised during his campaign to “open up our libel laws” to make it easier to sue media organisations for damages  —   singling out the New York Times, CNN, and the Washington Post, among others  —   and promising: “If I become president, they’re going to have such problems. ” Berlusconi’s rise in Italy was inexorably linked to his control of the media. He not only exerted influence over   organisations through his role as prime minister, but through his own media empire, including a major broadcaster and publishers.  “Many journalists were complicit even without being controlled, for example by accepting conditions, or when he chose journalists he preferred for interviews,” said Jacopo Iacoboni, a political journalist at La Stampa. In what was later called “the Bulgarian edict” Berlusconi in 2002 accused journalists at   RAI of using “television as a criminal means of communication” in part because of reports that alleged Berlusconi had ties with organised crime. The journalists were subsequently fired and banned from working for RAI. Berlusconi was ultimately acquitted of knowingly hiring an underage prostitute at his infamous “bunga bunga” parties, and of abusing his position to cover it up. But his tenure became synonymous with the everyday demeaning of women  —   particularly on television  —   as sex objects, as the prime minister regularly insulted and mocked women in public, even making sex jokes at public events meant to honour women’s achievements.  In Berlusconi’s Italy, a woman’s looks were paramount. The prime minister even appointed a former model and showgirl to serve as equal opportunities minister. Trump’s obsession with women’s looks has similarly been well documented throughout his campaign for president, including his rating women on a scale of   and numerous accusations of sexual harassment and assault. But in Italy there was also a backlash, and an awakening among some Italian women, according to Emma Bonino, the former foreign minister and feminist who helped secure abortion and divorce rights in Italy in the 1970s. “Berlusconi’s attitude prompted a sort of revolt from women, and women’s groups, who had been silent and absent for years, even on important women’s issues,” Bonino said. It prompted opposition to female stereotypes, particularly in the media, and the scourge of domestic violence, which had often gone unacknowledged, she said.  Berlusconi had an unspoken agreement with the Roman Catholic church that helped him hold on to power.  Italian bishops looked the other way and did not criticise what might otherwise have been deemed    behaviour, as long as Berlusconi helped them on their legislative agenda, including blocking   unions, limiting fertility treatments opposed by the church, and generally addressing their fear of being “swallowed up by secularisation, Islam [in the form of immigration] and liberalisation” said Massimo Faggioli, a church historian at Villanova University. Five years after his resignation from office, Italy still has no prospects of passing   marriage into law (though civil unions are now legal) lesbian and gay parents do not have legal rights over their children, IVF treatment is limited to married couples, and surrogacy  —   strongly opposed by the church  —   is illegal. Similarly, the   Trump   who has never convincingly spoken of having religious faith  —   won the support of four out of five white evangelicals, largely based on their hopes that Trump would elect conservative   judges on the supreme court. While it has received scant attention, Trump has also promised to repeal a 1954 ban that prevents   organisations like churches from getting involved in politics, a change that could give churches an even more powerful role in US politics. Last week Trump settled fraud lawsuits relating to Trump University for $25m, removing a legal headache despite having pledged to fight the cases to the bitter end.  He has also alleged that he is the subject of an audit by US tax authorities and, before his election, had threatened to sue women who had accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Berlusconi faced similar entanglements with the judicial system and the issues ultimately pressured him and constrained his ability to pass legislation. Prosecutors who sought to charge him with crimes were derided as unelected communists, and there a poisonous relationship soon developed between judges and prosecutors and the prime minister’s office. “Berlusconi tried to use his political power to defend himself, making laws and using his position as prime minister to delay trials. There were also several legal attempts  —   like making a law that as president of the republic you cannot go to trial as long as you are in power  —   but he never really succeeded,” said Orsina. Trump enters the White House after a contentious election in which he derided federal investigators at the FBI, but also after he was seen as having been helped by the FBI director, James Comey, who made a surprise announcement about the continuation of a probe into Hillary Clinton  —   which was later dropped  —   11 days before the election. Trump has also sought to delay a civil fraud trial into one of his businesses until after his inauguration. Like Trump, Berlusconi’s rise was fuelled by his   views, particularly against the Roma and, later, migrants. In his final years in office, defections from Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party forced him to look to Italy’s far right  —   even more than he had before  —   to keep his coalition, essentially forcing him to lock arms with the xenophobic Northern League, which has called for the expulsion of migrants. A similar dynamic may soon be at work in the US.  While Donald Trump this week called for the deportation of 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants who have allegedly committed crimes, he left the door open to even more deportations later on, even as the Republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who is a mainstream conservative, denied there was interest in a “deportation force”. A rupture between Trump and Ryan could force Trump to seek alliances among even more rightwing Republicans on immigration policy. The position of minorities in Italian society, according to the senator and human rights expert Francesco Palermo, was “affected severely” in large part due to a series of “emergency decrees” that sought to expel the Roma from Italy. Funds for traditional minorities were reduced and are now   of what they were in 2000, Palermo said, and migrants “were scapegoated for the overall decline of society”. “I do not believe minorities will be a direct target under the Trump administration, as this would immediately be under the spotlight. But more worrying, the deterioration of their situation will be a consequence of the societal climate. This is somewhat similar to the trend we observed in Italy under Berlusconi,” Palermo said. Berlusconi did not ultimately vanquish Italy’s democratic institutions. But the lasting damage he inflicted, according to Guy Dinmore, a former correspondent for the Financial Times who covered Berlusconi’s final term, came in the way his   premiership celebrated and normalised the flouting of rules, including on paying taxes. “What he did was to perpetuate the old system he inherited, which was a clientelist system where meritocracy had no place, and corruption is rife, and people were almost encouraged by Berlusconi not to pay their taxes. Italy was a swamp   …     and he made it worse,” Dinmore said. Journalist Iacoboni agreed, saying the lasting impact of Berlusconi was “the cultural idea that you could do anything in your own interests. ”  “He legitimised every kind of infraction of rules, going back to his television career in the 1980s. It was as if to say: ‘You Italians like to be gross with women? Well, I say to you, you can do this.’ I think this [idea you can do anything to further your own interests] is much worse than even the legal accusations. ” ",among polit figur congratul donald trump

100,"Barbara Gibb, mother of the Bee Gees, dies aged 95","Barbara Gibb, the mother of the three Gibb brothers who became pop band the Bee Gees, has died at the age of 95. Barbara, who was born and raised in Manchester, died of natural causes on Friday evening at her home in Miami, where she had lived for the past 20 years, according to a publicist for her eldest son, Barry Gibb. Her son, Barry, and daughter, Lesley, survive her. The family were living on the Isle of Man when she gave birth to Barry and the twins, Robin and Maurice, who would later go on to form The Bee Gees. She also had another son, Andy, and a daughter, Lesley, with her husband Hugh Gibb, a bandleader for the Hughie Gibb Orchestra in Manchester, whom she married in 1944. The couple managed their sons’ early music career and The Bee Gees became one of the most successful pop bands in history. As a band and through solo projects, the trio sold tens of millions of records. She survived the deaths of three of her five children. Andy, also a successful musician, died in 1988 aged 30 from the heart condition myocarditis. Maurice died unexpectedly in 2003 at the age of 53 due to complications from a twisted intestine, while his twin Robin died in 2012 aged 62 from liver and kidney failure after battling colorectal cancer.",barbara gibb mother three gibb brother becam band gee die barbara born rais manchest die natur caus friday even home miami live past year accord publicist eldest barri gibb barri daughter lesley surviv famili live isl gave birth barri twin robin mauric would later form gee also anoth andi daughter lesley husband hugh gibb bandlead hughi gibb orchestra manchest marri coupl manag son earli music career gee becam success band histori band solo project trio sold ten million record surviv death three five children andi also success musician die age heart condit myocard mauric die unexpectedli complic twist intestin twin robin die age liver kidney failur battl colorect cancer
101,Tiger Woods aims for December comeback ... and Jack Nicklaus’s record,"Tiger Woods, beset by injuries and the decline of his playing career, appears to have at least one person who still believes in him. And that person is Tiger Woods. In an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS on Thursday night, the former world No1 said he is targeting an imminent return to golf as well as more victories in the majors. Woods has not played competitively since August 2015 after three separate operations on his back, and pulled out of a planned return earlier this month after describing his game as “vulnerable”. But he told Rose on Thursday that he is “hoping to come back in December”. Rose then asked Woods if he expected to equal Jack Nicklaus’s record total of 18 majors. “No   …     I’ve accepted I’m going to get more,” Woods replied. Woods’s last victory in a major was at the 2008 US Open, the 14th major title of his career. Woods also described his respect for Nicklaus’s achievements. “I looked up to him, I looked at his record. . .. I wouldn’t say I lusted for his record. I just think that was the gold standard because he had won the most majors and the   Tour events. And here he is at 18. ”  Woods also said he missed competing against his fellow professionals. “Do I miss it? Absolutely, 100%. And to be at my age now, at 40 years old   …     I’m the first one to admit: I can’t do the things I used to be able to do. Most people can’t at my age, versus when they were younger. I have to find different ways to go about it. ” At his peak, Woods was arguably the most famous athlete in the world and he spoke about the pressures that came with that tag. “Well, it’s a burden in   …     the amount of obligations that I have at a tournament. The anonymity that was lost   …     if you look back, the only regret I have in life is not spending another year at Stanford [where Woods attended college] and I wish I would’ve had one more year. ”",tiger wood beset injuri declin play career appear least person still believ person tiger wood interview charli rose thursday night former world said target immin return golf well victori major wood play competit sinc august three separ oper back pull plan return earlier month describ game vulner told rose thursday hope come back decemb rose ask wood expect equal jack nicklau record total major accept go wood repli wood last victori major open major titl career wood also describ respect nicklau achiev look look record lust record think gold standard major tour event wood also said miss compet fellow profession miss absolut year first admit thing use abl most peopl versu younger find differ way peak wood arguabl famou athlet world spoke pressur came well burden amount oblig tournament anonym lost look back regret life spend anoth year stanford wood attend colleg wish would year
102,Emmys ratings sink to all-time low of 11.3 million viewers,"Ratings for the Emmys have fallen to an   low, with this year’s ceremony attracting just 11. 3 million viewers. The show, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel for ABC, fell 5% from last year’s broadcast and 22% in the key demo of adults aged  . There was major competition from Sunday Night Football on NBC and a strong performance by the first part of the CBS documentary The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey, as well as continued coverage of the New York and New Jersey bombings. In previous years, ratings have been boosted by NFL  . Despite the drop, Nielsen reported that the telecast did score 25. 9 million unique viewers for the night, which accounts for anyone who watched more than six minutes of the show. The news follows an   low for this February’s Oscars and a 34%    drop in viewers for August’s MTV VMA awards. This year’s ceremony was dominated by The People v OJ Simpson and Game of Thrones, which became the most awarded TV show in Emmys history, breaking Frasier’s record.

103,Where is the world’s most hi-tech city? (And it’s not San Francisco …),"Before long, Santiago could be a city full of electric vehicles charged by “smart” power grids, many of them driving on highways equipped with   automated variable toll pricing. Perhaps a new arrival to the Chilean capital would go for the chance to found a technology company, incentivised by programmes like the       Chile, in “Chilecon Valley”. And perhaps they’ll stay for the capital’s reputation boasting the most advanced public transit system in Latin America. Or they might opt for Africa instead of South America, to take advantage of the assistance offered by organisations like SmartXchange in Durban. Not only does South Africa’s third largest city now have an increasingly   middle class population, it has schools like the Durban University of Technology, whose Urban Futures Centre is even developing technological solutions to the common challenges of drug use, security and policing strategy. If these succeed, Durban, like Santiago, may count itself among the   cities sooner than the rest of the world could imagine. An urbanite cannot live by startup incubation alone  —   only implementing the latest technology within a sound built and social environment can make a city truly  . Indeed, I kept hearing the same answer from current and former San Franciscans asked to name the best such cities in the world right now: “Not San Francisco. ” Yet last year Tech Insider’s ranked the “undeniable epicentre of all things tech, from its gigantic   culture to its venture capital scene to its population of designers and programmers,” at the top spot. If San Francisco doesn’t rank among the most   cities in the world, which city could? The epicentre of tech lies less in San Francisco proper than in Silicon Valley to the south (Tech Insider’s list conflates the two). It’s the birthplace of the personal computer, now home to Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel and Stanford University, and the cradle of thousands upon thousands of startups. Only in recent years have large numbers of technology companies and their workers based themselves in urban San Francisco instead of the suburban Silicon Valley, and the resulting conflicts between the   bohemian population and these wealthy new arrivals have exposed its real, underdeveloped technological state. “Planners in 1996 had no way of predicting the tech boom,” admitted Taylor Huckaby, a representative of San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) agency in March in response to residents’ complaints about the unreliability of the city’s transport infrastructure. They’d grown especially fed up with its commuter rail network, designed and built at enormous expense in the 1960s and 70s, much of which, Huckaby tweeted through Bart’s official feed, “has reached the end of its useful life”. No matter how much app developing innovation San Francisco attracts  —   Twitter is headquartered there  —   the experience it provides San Franciscans remains, for the foreseeable future, decidedly  . Other cities have tried to become startup hubs, offering an environment equally attractive to currently small but potentially huge tech companies. The very nature of a mature city like San Francisco, with its old buildings and layers of regulation, throws serious obstacles to   modernisation, but some city builders have addressed that problem by starting afresh and raising a     metropolis from the ground up.  Masdar City  —   a walled, Norman   development in Abu Dhabi  —   began construction in 2008 at the behest of renewable energy company Masdar. The original $22bn (£18bn) plan envisioned a community of 50, 000, its energy and other resource use to be all centrally monitored and adjusted. But the global financial crisis deferred this urban dream, greatly slowing construction, curtailing ambitious plans for a personal rapid transit system, and rendering the stated goal of full carbon neutrality seemingly impossible. Only 5% of the planned smart city in the desert stands today. A more successful example has appeared eight miles from South Korea’s largest international airport: Songdo International Business District, built over 12 years on 600 hectares of reclaimed waterfront land at a cost of $40bn. It is both the world’s first smart city and largest private development in history. Computers embedded in the streets and structures form a citywide information network used for monitoring and maintenance. A pneumatic waste disposal system, obviating the need for garbage cans and trucks, directs all refuse to an automatic central processing facility underground. With all its   computational power, Songdo aims to go beyond the concept of the high technology smart city to become a technologically “ubiquitous city”. Data sensors continually collect information on the city’s flows of water, energy, and traffic for ongoing optimisation. A partnership between Songdo’s builders and Cisco Systems  —   the Silicon Valley maker of networking equipment  —   has so far led to the installation of a “telepresence” system, which enables instant audiovisual communication between residents. It also promises the citizenry of Songdo future domestic niceties such as appliances controllable by smartphones and systems to track the whereabouts of their children. On a private tour, representatives from developer and majority stakeholder Gale International described Songdo to me as not just a technological project but an “urbanistic” one. It synthesises, they said, the best elements of such classically great metropolises as Paris (wide boulevards) New York (Songdo’s own Central Park occupies nearly 10% of its land area) and Venice (visitors can boat down canals dug for the purpose). But not even they could deny that Songdo, with its often empty public spaces and  —   apart from a few deliberately   restaurants  —   eerie historical uniformity, has yet to replicate the urban essence of those places. Yet urban essence abounds on the other side of the Sea of Japan. As host of the 2020 Olympics, Tokyo intends to use the occasion to build a model city of the future in the form of a completely   Olympic Village. It will exist, of course, within a city the rest of the world has long seen as a tech spectacle perpetually on the cutting edge.  But as any longtime resident knows, life in Tokyo, with, for instance, the   appointments at bureaucratic branch offices, can feel frustratingly   as often as thrillingly  .  High technology has permeated life far more deeply elsewhere in Asia, most notably in the city state of Singapore. Its lack of resources, small size and high population density have demanded innovative solutions to   logistical and environmental urban problems, and its wealth and   government control have made those solutions feasible. Singapore, which integrates technology and urban planning to a unique degree, pioneered the   solution to the complications of urban life. Its traffic congestion charging system  —   the first in the world when implemented in 1975  —   now uses a network of cameras, sensors, and GPS devises that foresee and head off jams by adjusting the location and amount of the charge, bringing the government $50m in revenue per year. Street crossers also play a role in this web of technology: senior and disabled citizens, for instance, receive radio frequency identification cards that will keep the crossing lights on for them  —   along with the free   internet every Singaporean gets. Though no one can deny Singapore’s technological acumen, its   image and paternalistic style of governance could be   for some. But across the South China Sea over in Hong Kong, the   region possesses equally fast internet. It has long been a part of life in Hong Kong, as has the Octopus, the contactless   system used to pay transport fares when introduced in 1997  —   but is now the payment system of choice for almost everything. The city’s increasingly ubiquitous fingerprint scanners allow its citizens easier and more secure passage to and fro. But even some of the less overtly futuristic cities in Europe also stand a chance of emerging as the most   cities of this century. Barcelona, which has perfected most of the traditional niceties of urban life, and continues to dramatically improve its streets, has more recently outfitted itself with   lights on the streets, touchscreen information stations, traffic and pollution sensors, and charging points for phones and vehicles alike. In collaboration with   universities, Spanish automaker Seat has got to work converting existing parking facilities into   service intensive, transit oriented “microcities”. But perhaps the most technologically promising European capital is on the other end of the continent: Tallinn, Estonia, the birthplace of Skype. The country plowed all the resources it could into information technology after gaining its independence in 1991, and it shows: signs point to the nearest hotspot where one can tap into the   data services available, well before they made it to the US and the UK. Over a decade ago, Tallinn became the first city to hold elections online, through the same system citizens use to pay their taxes and view all government data pertaining to them. Access to these features of Estonian technological life greatly widened when the country introduced a convenient system of   in 2014. For my part, I moved from California to Seoul. Home to such tech intensive conglomerates as Samsung and LG, the capital of South Korea has the most plausible claim to the title of the world’s most   city, despite the haphazardness of the unprecedented rapid development following its   destruction in the Korean War. “What a Londoner notices first is the ways in which the city is more advanced than his own,” historian Perry Anderson wrote 20 years ago, marvelling at this        metropolis that seemingly materialised from nowhere. “One is constantly struck by the intelligence brought to the inconspicuous details of living, as if the routines of urban existence were being freshly invented for the first time. ” South Korea’s comprehensive internet infrastructure already sets speed records, and the government plans to widely implement 5G, the next generation of wireless connections, by the year 2020. And Seoulites can connect wherever they please  —   not only at the city’s more than 10, 000 free   hot spots, but even underground, while riding one of the finest metro systems in the world.   displays keep riders apprised of the location of the next train, and the same goes for buses. Commuters can also stop at one of the station’s “virtual stores” where, simply by snapping a picture of their desired product with their smartphone, they can arrange for its delivery to their home the very same day. Yet even in Seoul, the integration of the   into urban life occasionally gets stifled: a 1999 law meant to standardise internet payment systems has forced South Koreans to use increasingly outdated web browsers, and economic protectionism (often under the banner of national security) tends to render international   sites useless, as well as mapping and   applications. However, the country has announced intentions of clearing up some of these issues by the time of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The fruits of humanity’s now seemingly constant technological revolutions and the living patterns of our urban population currently integrate nowhere better than they do in Seoul. Yet the title of the world’s most   city could go anywhere in the next decade: to a city about to emerge triumphantly from the developing world, to a historic capital that has turned to the future, to a slick development that has settled into its urban identity   …     or to some place as yet barely imagined.

104,Manchester United’s Pogba fails to live up to price tag in draw at Liverpool,"As this game   Paul Pogba’s “second coming” at Manchester United stood at 10 appearances, one goal, and no     display. There had been flashes of quality but little else to suggest the world’s most expensive footballer was living up to the billing. Nearly two months to the day since his first appearance of the season  —   a promising turn in the   win over Southampton  —   here was a perfect opponent to deliver against. To be a defining factor for United against Liverpool at Anfield is precisely the kind of performance for which £93. 2m was splurged on Pogba, and why José Mourinho was so keen to make him the headline summer signing. His arrival at United caused a minor spat between the Portuguese and Jürgen Klopp. The Liverpool manager questioned Pogba’s price and voiced a hope it would not become the norm. “The day that this is football I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together,” he said. “I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money. ” Arsène Wegner, the Arsenal manager, spoke of similar concerns, to prompt a classic Mourinho response: “When I heard some of the comments and some of the managers criticising that, I don’t think they ever have this problem because, to have this problem, you need to be at one of the top clubs in the world. So at Man United it can happen. ” The transfer did indeed take place but so far the return on the investment has been disappointing. Part of the issue has been where the Frenchman should operate. Pogba has been in the pair of a 4‑2‑3‑1, on the   side of the middle trio in a 4‑3‑3, and last night he was shifted again, placed by his manager in the No10 berth in the former formation. This meant no Juan Mata, the playmaker preferred by Mourinho over Wayne Rooney and who was pivotal in the   hiding of Leicester City in United’s outstanding performance under the new manager. If this means Rooney is now effectively third choice for the position, then what he saw from the bench was a tentative Pogba as the contest unfolded. There was a dink to Ander Herrera that was pretty but aimless a run down a blind alley near Liverpool’s area which left him sprawling a wild   shot and a few clumsy touches that ceded possession. The plus side? A    with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the odd tackle, and that was about it. Pogba is hardly renowned for being a ball artist whose vision splits teams open. The truth is that Mata’s absence here left this United side merely a functional unit, which may have been Mourinho’s intention. They stifled and stymied Liverpool for the greater part of the first half, until Klopp’s men gained a foothold over the closing 10 minutes. This, though, was just what Pogba had failed to do as   arrived  —   establish himself. All the    did was underline Graeme Souness’s damning appraisal of him. The Scot, whose stellar career (mainly with Liverpool) makes him highly qualified to talk about accomplished midfield play, said: “Pogba may eventually be £100m worth, but right now I don’t see him anywhere near that. I see a young man who’s struggling to find his best position and best form in a team that’s struggling to find their best form. ” Yet at the interval Mourinho would have been content. His side had quietened Liverpool  —   and their support  —   and there was scant threat to their goal. But Pogba’s contribution to this was minimal, which meant as long as United kept on level terms it might be acceptable to their manager. The sense that a footballer bought to be the present and future of United should do more remained. For a club built on the scintillating talents of George Best, Eric Cantona and Rooney to have the next supposed   so muted is odd. Even when Pogba tried to   Jordan Henderson off the ball he came off second best. There was a scrap of encouragement when he supplied the cross from which Zlatan Ibrahimovic might have scored, but as the second half progressed the case grew for Mata or Rooney to enter as Pogba’s ineffectiveness meant United would have lost little had he been withdrawn. As Souness also said, United are not the lean, mean machine which Mourinho’s champion sides were. This may not help Pogba but the very best players are the ones who make a difference to the side. “I don’t see him having a great understanding of the game,” the former Liverpool manager added. It may seem harsh, but on this evidence Souness’s view can be understood. Pogba’s challenge is to prove it wrong.",game paul pogba second come manchest unit stood appear goal display there flash qualiti littl els suggest world expens footbal live bill nearli month sinc first appear season promis turn southampton perfect oppon deliv defin factor unit liverpool anfield precis kind perform splurg pogba mourinho keen make headlin summer sign arriv unit caus minor spat portugues rgen klopp liverpool manag question pogba price voic hope would becom norm footbal game play togeth said want differ would even differ could spend money wegner arsen manag spoke similar concern prompt classic mourinho respons when heard comment manag criticis think ever problem problem need club world unit happen transfer inde take place return invest disappoint part issu frenchman oper pogba pair side middl trio last night shift place manag berth former format thi meant juan mata playmak prefer mourinho wayn rooney pivot hide leicest citi unit outstand perform manag mean rooney effect third choic posit bench tent pogba contest unfold there dink ander herrera pretti aimless blind alley near liverpool area left sprawl wild shot clumsi touch cede possess plu side zlatan ibrahimov tackl pogba hardli renown ball artist whose vision split team open truth mata absenc left unit side mere function unit mourinho intent they stifl stymi liverpool greater part first half klopp gain foothold close minut thi though pogba fail arriv establish underlin graem souness damn apprais scot whose stellar career mainli liverpool make highli qualifi talk accomplish midfield play said pogba eventu worth right anywher near young struggl find best posit best form team struggl find best form interv mourinho would content side quieten liverpool support scant threat goal pogba contribut minim meant long unit kept level term might accept manag sens footbal bought present futur unit remain club built scintil talent georg best eric cantona rooney next suppos mute even pogba tri jordan henderson ball came second best there scrap encourag suppli cross zlatan ibrahimov might score second half progress case grew mata rooney enter pogba ineffect meant unit would lost littl withdrawn souness also said unit lean mean machin mourinho champion side thi help pogba best player one make differ side great understand game former liverpool manag ad seem harsh evid souness view understood pogba challeng prove wrong
105,Satellite eye on Earth: June 2016 – in pictures,"Stagnant lakes stretch   across the upper reaches of the Volga river delta in southern Russia. The lakes are trapped by sandy mounds, left behind after the Caspian Sea’s level rose then fell in the wake of the last ice age. The United Kingdom seen from the recently launched   satellite on 9 May. At the top centre of the image, aircraft contrails form an elongated   trail in the sky, and top right, some snow still covers southern Norway. Bottom right, part of the Netherlands with Lake Markermeer clearly visible. In the southern North   Channel, an algal bloom is distinguishable in shades of light blue and green, while, closer to the coast brown sediment from rivers and streams runs into the sea. The Scottish Highlands at the tip of the UK appear light brown, representing bare soil and rock formations, with some vegetation. The rest of the island, as well as the visible part of Ireland, are very green, representing dense vegetation.  ’s Ocean and Land Colour Instrument is a new eye on Earth, monitoring ocean ecosystems, supporting crop management and agriculture, and providing estimates of atmospheric aerosol and clouds  —   all of which will bring significant benefits to society through more informed  . Scanning the monotonous,   surface of the Sahara desert, an astronaut aboard the international space station saw small, dark patches next to a long, ragged cliff in Egypt’s western desert. The dark patches are date and olive groves in the Bahariya oasis (population 27, 000) one of several small places in Egypt’s deserts where people can live. The oasis has a rich history, going back at least to Egypt’s middle kingdom (  BCE) when agricultural products from the oasis were exported to the Nile valley. Alexander the Great may have passed through, even though it is so remote (380km   of Cairo). The Valley of the Golden Mummies in Bahariya purportedly holds as many as 10, 000 undisturbed mummies of Roman and Greek aristocrats, dating from 332 BCE to 395 AD. Aqueducts built by the Roman Empire are still used today to carry water to groves and farms. In recent years, a new road between Bahariya and Cairo has brought significant tourist traffic coming to see the remnants of ancient life. Monsoon rains began arriving across India in early June 2016. For many Indians, it was not a moment too soon. After three underwhelming monsoon seasons, broad swaths of the country have been gripped by drought. An estimated 330 million people have been affected by depleted water supplies. Collectively, India’s 91 major reservoirs stood at 16% of their storage capacity on 9 June 2016, according to the nation’s Central Water Commission (CWC). That is about 58% of the water that was available in June 2015 and about 79% of the   average. Of all of India’s reservoirs, Panchet Hill in Jharkhand was among the lowest compared to the   average. In the first week of June 2016, the reservoir stood at 4% of capacity the average for June is 40%. These images show the reservoir on 10 June 2015 and 12 June 2016. The East Siberian sea wears a cap of frozen seawater in autumn and winter, with the maximum thickness occurring between February and April. As spring arrives the ice begins to thin and slowly thaw, speeding up in July. In this image taken on 4 June, ice has pulled away from the coastline in the east and the bright white ice has taken on a blue appearance as it thins and become waterlogged. Open water can be seen in the west section of the image, and a very large crack has developed running parallel to the shore.  These mountains in   in southern Kyrgyzstan are home to radioactive dumps  —   the product of former Soviet uranium tailing mines. Today the region is labelled as one of the world’s critically polluted areas. In the   grasslands in Kazakhstan one of the few features that stand out from space is Lake Tengiz, the only large lake (1, 590 sq km, 615 sq miles) in northern Kazakhstan. Through white wisps of cloud, you can see the 50   eastern shore of the lake, with its thin, winding islands and white beaches. The islands and intervening waterways make a rich habitat for birds —   at least 318 species of birds have been identified 22 of them are endangered. It is the northernmost habitat of the pink flamingo. The lake system is Kazakhstan’s first Unesco world heritage site, and it has been declared a Ramsar wetland site of international importance. Part of the richness of area is its complex hydrology. Fresh water enters the system via the Kulanutpes river, so there are small lakes (lower right) full of fresh water. But in this closed basin, the water in the main lake (top) slowly evaporates, becoming salty. Winds stir up bigger waves on the main lake, dispersing sediment and salt and making the water a cloudier and lighter  .   This map of ocean sea surface temperature, clearly shows the movement of warm water through the Gulf Stream, a powerful current of warm water running through the Atlantic Ocean. Starting in the Gulf of Mexico, the current travels around the Florida panhandle and accelerates up the east coast of the US and Canada before stretching across the ocean toward Europe. The temperature contrast along the edge of the Gulf Stream can increase the intensity of cyclones moving up the coast. During late June and July, conditions suitable for the development of tropical cyclones move from the Caribbean Sea and follow the Gulf Stream to the Gulf of Mexico or up the east coast. Instruments on satellites can measure the temperature of the surface water from hundreds and even thousands of miles away in space. These measurements can then be mapped and are a major factor for predicting weather and monitoring climate change. Arctic sea ice extent set another record low, with the average extent for May 2016 becoming the lowest extent for the month since satellite observations began, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center  This record low may not come as a surprise, however, following a record low extent in January, February, and April 2016. May’s average extent was 680, 000 sq km (224, 000 sq miles) below the previous record for the month, set in 2004. During the month, daily sea ice extents tracked roughly 600, 000 sq km below any previous year in the   satellite record. Daily extents in May were also two to four weeks ahead of levels seen in 2012, which had the lowest Arctic sea ice minimum extent on the satellite record (typically the summer melting season runs March to September). The monthly average extent for May 2016 is more than 1m sq km below that observed in May 2012. This image, from 30 May 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the   coast of Alaska. Snow blankets the mountain peaks in south central Alaska as smoke colours the skies to the west in   2016. The largest mountain range is the Alaska range, starting at the eastern border with Canada and arcing across the north of south central Alaska before ending to the west of the rugged Kenai peninsula. The arc of mountains close to the coast is made up of the Chugach mountains in the east and the Kenai mountains in the west. On the coast, Anchorage, Alaska’s most populous city, sits at the terminus of the Cook Inlet.  Thanks to a warm winter and an early, warm spring, fire risk is high across Alaska and fires have been abundant across the state, particularly in the north central region. The Alaska Wildland Fire website reported that 10, 292 lightning strikes were recorded between 6am and 6pm on 26 June, resulting in at least 37 new fires. In this image of Rome’s Castelli area Lake Albano is clearly visible on bottom right, while the town of Frascati, home to ESA’s Earth Observation Centre, is located just further north.  In 1960, 5 million people lived in Rio de Janeiro. By 2015, the population had swollen to 12. 2 million, making it Brazil’s second largest city. During the Olympics in August 2016, the city expects an additional 500, 000 people to visit. To accommodate those visitors, billions of dollars have been spent upgrading and building infrastructure, reducing crime, and addressing environmental issues. While Olympic venues are located in several neighbourhoods, most events will occur in Barra da Tijuca, a coastal neighbourhood in the city’s west zone. Barra da Tijuca is one of the youngest and most affluent neighbourhoods in Rio it is also the fastest growing. Between 1990 and 2010, the population increased threefold from 100, 000 to 300, 000. Many people were drawn to the neighbourhood by its easy access to an   ( ) beach, the longest in Rio, and a large shopping mall. These images show how the area dramatically changed between September 1984 and September 2015. Forested areas are green urbanised areas are grey. The Ojibwa tribe has a   legend that explains how the dunes of Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore and two nearby islands in Lake Michigan were formed. The legend says that long ago, a mother bear and two cubs were driven into the lake by fires on land. After hours of swimming, the mother bear reached the far shore of the lake. But when she turned around to look for her cubs both of them had slipped beneath the lake surface and disappeared. The mother bear spent weeks staring out across the lake in the hopes they would eventually swim ashore, until heartbroken she finally lay down to sleep on a bluff overlooking the lake and never woke up. In recognition of her suffering, the Ojibwa say a powerful spirit covered her with sand and made her two cubs rise above the water as North and South Manitou island. Geologists have a different way of explaining the formation of the dunes and the two islands. During the last ice age, glaciers spread southward from Canada, burying the area under thick sheets of ice. As these sheets of ice slid southward, they ground parts of the underlying bedrock into sand under their tremendous weight. When the ice eventually retreated about 12, 000 years ago, it left behind large piles of sand and rock debris called moraines, creating the hilly terrain visible along the lakeshore today. Sand deposited by glaciers is the main ingredient for the “perched dunes” located on bluffs relatively high above the water level. Meanwhile, the combined pounding from winds, waves, and lake ice also built dunes at lower elevations along the shoreline from beach sand. The National Park Service uses images like this to monitor changes in the landscape over time. For example, changes in Landsat images between 2006 and 2011 showed a sharp increase in forest disturbance in 2009. During that year, a forest pathogen caused higher than normal levels of deforestation. Dust storms over the Red Sea are not uncommon. But sometimes atmospheric conditions and topography combine to produce a storm that appears extraordinary in satellite imagery. In this image of airborne dust winds appear to be blowing    out of Africa. Gaps in   mountain ranges become pathways through which winds can carry dust and sand from inland areas toward the sea. Scientists have been studying the dust in this area for a number of reasons. In general, dust in   conditions reflects sunlight and causes radiative cooling of the land and atmosphere. According to scientists, the effects on the energy balance of the Red Sea have not been well quantified. In addition, dust generated over the coastal area is often deposited in the sea. This provides an important nutrient supply to the Red Sea, which otherwise has very low nutrient levels, particularly in its more northern reaches. In late June 2016, thick plumes of smoke were rising from dozens of large wildfires   of Krasnoyarsk in   Russia. Red outlines indicate hot spots associated with fire. Notice the lack of clouds around the fires in the upper image it is possible that heat rising from the fires has prevented the formation of clouds. The lower image highlights a cluster of intense fires north of the Angara river. According to reporting by Komsomolskaya Pravda, many of the fires were triggered by lightning storms. More than 600 people have been involved in fighting the blazes. The fires are located in isolated areas and do not pose threats to population centres.    A string of wildfires burns in the Sierra Madre mountain forests of western Mexico, near the borders of the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. According to data from the Mexican environment ministry, the Mexican forest fire season normally occurs between January and July. March and April are the major fire months because they coincide with the dry season. Human activities cause an estimated 97% of the wildfires, with agricultural and livestock production activity causing 54%. Urban Auckland rests on an ancient volcanic field. Look closely at this image from a RapidEye satellite and you’ll find maars (shallow   craters) and cinder cones intermingled with suburban housing developments and city green spaces.  This image of Greece, Turkey and Libya shows their distinct relief differences. In the middle of the image is the Greek island of Crete, dominated by harsh mountains rising out of the sea, along with natural harbours, coastal plains and the typical Mediterranean scrub.   of Crete is a large part of Greece’s mainland, showing dense vegetation and agricultural landscape, while under the clouds a small part of Italy’s “heel and tip” are visible. Top right is part of   Turkey with a mixture of agricultural landscape and mountainous regions, where bare soil and rock formations prevail.

106,Star Trek Beyond soars to top of US weekend box office,"Star Trek Beyond landed atop the weekend US box office, soaring to $59. 6m in North American ticket sales and knocking Universal’s The Secret Life of Pets from the No1 spot, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Pets was the    film at theaters, adding $29. 3m to its stellar $260m earnings to date. Paramount’s Star Trek Beyond is the third film since JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise in 2009. Despite the latest release opening $20m behind 2009’s Star Trek, experts say it’s still promising. “This is a solid enough debut to tell them there’s still enough interest in Star Trek to keep this franchise alive,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the box office tracker comScore.  Dergarabedian did not think the film was hurt by the unexpected loss of one of its stars. The actor Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov, was killed in a freak car accident last month. “The tragic passing of Anton Yelchin made it bittersweet for fans,” Dergarabedian said. The Secret Life of Pets and Ghostbusters bested the weekend’s other new releases. Warner Bros’   horror Lights Out tied with Ghostbusters for third place with $21. 6m, while Fox’s animated Ice Age: Collision Course debuted with $21m. Fox Searchlight’s Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie opened outside the top 10 with $1. 8m.",star trek beyond land atop weekend offic soar north american ticket sale knock univers secret life pet spot accord studio estim sunday pet film theater ad stellar earn date paramount star trek beyond third film sinc abram reboot franchis despit latest releas open behind star trek expert still promis thi solid enough debut tell still enough interest star trek keep franchis aliv said paul dergarabedian senior media analyst offic tracker comscor dergarabedian think film hurt unexpect loss star actor anton yelchin play chekov kill freak accid last month tragic pass anton yelchin made bittersweet fan dergarabedian said secret life pet ghostbust best weekend releas warner bro horror light tie ghostbust third place anim collis cours debut searchlight absolut fabul movi open outsid
107,North Dakota arrest warrant for Amy Goodman raises fears for press freedom,"North Dakota police have issued an arrest warrant for the Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman, who has been reporting on the Native American protests against an oil pipeline, accusing her of entering “private property” to conduct interviews. The charges have raised concerns about possible free speech violations and press intimidation, since the Morton county sheriff’s office accused the   broadcast journalist after Democracy Now! filmed security guards working for the Dakota access pipeline using dogs and pepper spray on protesters. “This is an unacceptable violation of freedom of the press,” Goodman said in a statement after police accused her of criminal trespass, a misdemeanor offense. On 3 September, Goodman reported at the site of the Native   protest of a controversial $3. 8bn oil pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says poses a threat to its water supply and could damage its cultural heritage.  Goodman’s dispatch on the use of dogs quickly spread online and was viewed more than 13m times on the news program’s Facebook page. Many outlets rebroadcast the footage, including CBS, NBC, NPR and CNN, according to Democracy Now!. An 8 September criminal complaint was filed against Goodman and Cody Hall, a protest organizer. The charging document from the state’s attorney for Morton County calls on the defendants to be “arrested and dealt with according to law”. Lindsay Wold, a special agent with the North Dakota bureau of criminal investigation, wrote in an affidavit that a “large group of protesters” were blocking a highway and that employees of the Dakota access pipeline were working in a nearby field, “utilizing heavy equipment to clear the land”. Security workers had formed a line to try to block the activists, Wold wrote. The agent alleged that the protesters broke through a fence, crossed on to the private land, halted the employees from working, and assaulted security guards. “Amy Goodman can be seen on video on the private property that is beyond the border of the fence,” Wold wrote. The agent also cited damage on 6 September to the pipeline’s equipment, including a flat tire and dirt placed in the fuel tanks of several vehicles. Democracy Now! quoted a protester at the time describing the dogs violently attacking activists: “These people are just threatening all of us with these dogs. And she, that woman over there, she was charging, and it bit somebody right in the face. ” “The dog has blood in its nose and its mouth,” Goodman said. “Why are you letting their, her dog go after the protesters? It’s covered in blood. ” Denis Moynihan, special projects coordinator for Democracy Now! declined to comment further on Monday, but confirmed that Goodman had not been arrested. Goodman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for the sheriff and prosecutor’s office declined to comment. Deputies stopped Hall on 9 September, allegedly for “expired tabs” and then arrested him for two counts of criminal trespass, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. The US army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior, which is responsible for Native American affairs, announced on Friday that it would delay issuing permits to the pipeline to dig on federal land by the Missouri river, above the Standing Rock reservation. The government said that it would also discuss with tribes how “to better ensure meaningful tribal input into   reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights”. The pipeline is slated to transport fracked crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago, inspiring an unprecedented gathering of Native American protesters. Some protest organizers have lamented that although the pipeline threats echo the dangers of the defeated Keystone XL pipeline, the North Dakota controversy has received much less attention from the media and major environmental groups.  Democracy Now! said it is now consulting with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and lawyers in North Dakota. CCR’s legal director, Baher Azmy, told Democracy Now! “This is clearly a violation of the first amendment   …     an attempt to repress this important political movement by silencing media coverage. ” The sheriff’s office said there have been 38 arrests associated with the protest.",north dakota polic issu arrest warrant democraci host goodman report nativ american protest pipelin accus enter privat properti conduct interview charg rais concern possibl free speech violat press intimid sinc morton counti sheriff offic accus broadcast journalist democraci film secur guard work dakota access pipelin use dog pepper spray protest thi unaccept violat freedom press goodman said statement polic accus crimin trespass misdemeanor offens septemb goodman report site nativ protest controversi pipelin stand rock sioux tribe say pose threat water suppli could damag cultur heritag goodman dispatch dog quickli spread onlin view time news program facebook page mani outlet rebroadcast footag includ accord democraci septemb crimin complaint file goodman codi hall protest organ charg document state attorney morton counti call defend arrest dealt accord lindsay wold special agent north dakota bureau crimin investig wrote affidavit larg group protest block highway employe dakota access pipelin work nearbi field util heavi equip clear land secur worker form line block activist wold wrote agent alleg protest broke fenc cross privat land halt employe work assault secur guard goodman seen video privat properti beyond border fenc wold wrote agent also cite damag septemb pipelin equip includ flat tire dirt place fuel tank sever vehicl democraci quot protest time describ dog violent attack activist these peopl threaten dog woman charg somebodi right face blood nose mouth goodman said let protest cover blood deni moynihan special project coordin democraci declin comment monday confirm goodman arrest goodman immedi respond request comment spokespeopl sheriff prosecutor offic declin comment deputi stop hall septemb allegedli expir tab arrest count crimin trespass sheriff offic said statement armi depart justic depart interior respons nativ american affair announc friday would delay issu permit pipelin feder land missouri river stand rock reserv govern said would also discuss tribe better ensur meaning tribal input review decis protect tribal land resourc treati right pipelin slate transport frack crude bakken field north dakota refineri near chicago inspir unpreced gather nativ american protest some protest organ lament although pipelin threat echo danger defeat keyston pipelin north dakota controversi receiv much less attent media major environment group democraci said consult center constitut right lawyer north dakota legal director baher azmi told democraci thi clearli violat first amend attempt repress import polit movement silenc media coverag sheriff offic said arrest associ protest
108,’Why are you still here?’ asks EU’s Juncker amid barrage of Nigel Farage,"The European commission president,   Juncker, has clashed bitterly with Nigel Farage, pointedly asking the Ukip leader in front of the European parliament in Brussels: “Why are you still here?” In extraordinary scenes, Juncker said on Tuesday that he respected British democracy and last Thursday’s seismic vote for the UK to leave the European Union. There was a smattering of applause in the chamber. The former Luxembourg prime minister then broke off from his speech in French and addressed Farage, sitting to his immediate right, in English. “That’s the last time you are applauding here. And to some extent I’m really surprised that you are here,” Juncker said. “You were fighting for the exit. The British people voted in favour of the exit why are you here?” he asked. Earlier the two men had embraced each other, and swapped a few words, ahead of the parliamentary session in the Belgian capital and a summit attended by David Cameron and other European leaders. Juncker even   Farage near the cheek. But the proceedings quickly degenerated into noisy  . In his own speech Farage began by sardonically thanking his fellow MEPs for “the warm welcome” before putting the boot in.  “When I came here 17 years ago and said I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union you all laughed at me. Well, I have to say, you’re not laughing now are you?” he taunted. “And the reason you’re so upset, the reason you’re so angry, has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning. You, as a political project, are in denial. You are in denial that your currency is failing,” Farage said. Despite urging a “ ” conversation between the EU and Britain, Farage continued in a similarly mocking vein throughout his monologue, at one point telling MEPs: “Virtually none of you have ever done a proper job in your lives. ” The MEPs responded to his oration with a mixture of boos, groans, shouts and ironic applause.  Amid uproar, the parliament’s president, Martin Schulz, tried to restore order while himself taking a dig at Farage. He told MEPs: “I understand that you are emotional, but you’re acting like Ukip normally acts in the chamber. So please don’t imitate them. ” His efforts did little to calm the atmosphere as Farage went on to tell MEPs that any attempt to impose trade barriers on the UK would backfire, claiming German   workers as being among those who would suffer. He said Britain could be “your greatest friend” provided the EU did not thwart the UK’s global ambition. The UK should invoke article 50 of the Lisbon treaty soon to begin its withdrawal from the EU, Farage said. “I don’t think we should spend too long doing it. ” Farage enjoyed support from the   French politician and Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, who spoke next. She called last Thursday’s referendum vote the “people’s spring” and “the most important historic event on the continent since the fall of the Berlin Wall”. In almost poetic tones, Le Pen exclaimed: “Dear colleagues, why are you getting het up? Look how beautiful history is! The UK is leaving!” She said Brexit was “a sign of liberty and freedom” “a cry of love” even, and signified “the great emancipation” of the British people. Others, however, dished it back to Farage in terms of bitter sarcasm.  The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt said: “I am shocked, Mr Farage. You are presenting yourself as the defender of the little man, while you have an offshore financial construction. ”  As Farage laughed, Verhofstadt added: “OK, let’s be positive, we are getting rid of the biggest waste of EU budget: your salary. ” The German MEP Manfred Weber, a close ally of Angela Merkel, accused Farage of lying over his promise that the NHS would receive £350m a week in the wake of Brexit. “Shame on you,” he said, to loud applause.  Ukip’s only Westminster MP, Douglas Carswell, was similarly unimpressed by Farage’s performance. He told LBC radio that “resorting to that sort of language is possibly not in the national interest. It struck precisely the wrong tone. ” When the Farage kerfuffle was over, the session moved on.  The warmest applause  —   indeed, a standing ovation  —   came for an emotional Scottish MEP, Alyn Smith. “We will need cool heads and warm hearts,” he urged his fellow parliamentarians. “But please, remember this: Scotland did not let you down. I beg you, do not let Scotland down now. ”",european commiss presid juncker clash bitterli nigel farag pointedli ask ukip leader front european parliament brussel still extraordinari scene juncker said tuesday respect british democraci last thursday seismic vote leav european union there smatter applaus chamber former luxembourg prime minist broke speech french address farag sit immedi right english that last time applaud extent realli surpris juncker said fight exit british peopl vote favour exit ask earlier embrac swap word ahead parliamentari session belgian capit summit attend david cameron european leader juncker even farag near cheek proceed quickli degener noisi speech farag began sardon thank fellow mep warm welcom put boot when came year said want lead campaign britain leav european union laugh well laugh taunt reason upset reason angri perfectli clear angri exchang morn polit project denial denial currenc fail farag said despit urg convers britain farag continu similarli mock vein throughout monologu point tell mep virtual none ever done proper live mep respond orat mixtur boo groan shout iron applaus amid uproar parliament presid martin schulz tri restor order take farag told mep understand emot act like ukip normal act chamber pleas imit effort littl calm atmospher farag went tell mep attempt impos trade barrier would backfir claim german worker among would suffer said britain could greatest friend provid thwart global ambit invok articl lisbon treati soon begin withdraw farag said think spend long farag enjoy support french politician front nation leader marin spoke next call last thursday referendum vote peopl spring import histor event contin sinc fall berlin wall almost poetic tone exclaim dear colleagu get look beauti histori leav said brexit sign liberti freedom love even signifi great emancip british peopl other howev dish back farag term bitter sarcasm former belgian prime minist verhofstadt said shock farag present defend littl offshor financi construct farag laugh verhofstadt ad posit get biggest wast budget salari german manfr weber close alli angela merkel accus farag lie promis would receiv week wake brexit shame said loud applaus ukip westminst dougla carswel similarli unimpress farag perform told radio resort sort languag possibl nation interest struck precis wrong tone when farag kerfuffl session move warmest applaus inde stand ovat came emot scottish alyn smith need cool head warm heart urg fellow parliamentarian pleas rememb scotland scotland
109,Alan Rickman remembered by Ian Rickson,"I first met Alan when I started running the Royal Court in the late 1990s. Despite how incredibly busy he was, he offered himself to me as a kind of generous lieutenant, ready to fight on behalf of the theatre, or sought to give focused and insightful encouragement. You need people like that. When I became aware that he actually played this role for multitudes of people it didn’t diminish how lucky I felt. In fact, earlier this year, when I was called to his hospital bedside days before he died, to [prepare to]direct his memorial, I realised what an impossible task it would be to include the massive range of people whom Alan had deeply touched. Here was a man who lived his socialism by repeatedly giving to others. He gave his time to a host of urgent issues his presence to organisations he believed in and in the most subtle way possible he financially supported a range of different individuals and causes that were simply in need. One thing Alan was especially passionate about was the political situation in the West Bank, and he responded to this both as a citizen and an artist. He came to me at the Royal Court with an imaginative idea to make a play from the diaries of Rachel Corrie, a young activist who tragically died when run over by a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier. Alongside the journalist Kath Viner and the actor Megan Dodds, Alan made a stunning show that went from the tiny Theatre Upstairs to the West End, New York, and is still produced all over the world. His direction was typically selfless, detailed and meticulous and his care of Rachel’s family, as they processed their grief through rehearing their daughter’s words, was mighty. Before I sound like I am sanctifying Alan I will add that his support and engagement, in the best sense, was often challenging. He could cut you down to size with a withering remark, make perceptive criticisms more useful than general praise, and be forcefully direct. This  —   for Alan  —   was about the level of his engagement, which was committed and principled. In this sense he was a tribal elder who we all set our compasses by. When the tribal elder passes, the tribe suffers. There is no one like him to take his place. Going back to his last weeks, earlier this year, what struck me was how all his thoughts were about those left behind: finding the right song to honour Rima, his widow, at the memorial (he chose Take It With Me by Tom Waits) choosing people who he felt would be most able to speak, and sparing those for whom it might be too demanding. Choosing material that was enlivening, amid the upset  —   like the exuberant video of Fred Astaire and others dancing to Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk  —   as well as rousing: a speech from a French revolutionary fighter from an early TV play he’d done in the 1980s. When I asked him how he felt about dying, he said  —   after a pause  —   “calm”. Perhaps that generosity of spirit had enabled him to get his house in order (he literally furnished a new house for Rima for her new life) say goodbye to as many people as he could, and hopefully feel a sense of pride at how much he had achieved in his life. In that cold January, when Alan died (in the same week as David Bowie) you realised  —   through his popular work on screen, particularly in the Harry Potter films  —   that Alan functioned as a kind of mythic uncle figure for a generation of young people who had grown up with him. He might have seemed, in retrospect, like an icon of the establishment, but let’s not forget that Alan came from a   family in   Acton. I’m sure these roots gave him this ability to find affinity with anyone who crossed his path  —   from starstruck autograph hunters to refugees in need of shelter. Alan deplored injustice, inequality and hypocrisy. He loved the industry he worked in, and the potential of art for everyone. His celebrity was irrelevant to him, except as a tool to help give light to all the things he believed in. That light still shines.

110,Nani: ‘United contract could have been best moment of my life – but it turned into the worst’,"Nani could not understand it. His mind was scrambled and the situation would affect him physically. The Portugal winger had been given a new   contract at Manchester United in September 2013 by the manager, David Moyes, and, having joined from Sporting Lisbon in 2007, he felt wanted and ready to fire himself to higher levels. Then Moyes did not play him. Or at least he hardly did so. In   Nani would start only seven Premier League games. “It could have been the best moment of my life but it turned into the worst,” Nani says. “After you sign a contract like that, you think all the people will be behind you and help you. And you see the opposite. Then the stress comes. I was down and, when it’s like that, of course, the injuries come too. It was a bad moment. It was something that made me very down, very disappointed. ” There were fewer shades of grey at the beginning of the following season under Moyes’s successor, Louis van Gaal. “He told me that, if I wanted to stay to fight for a position, then good but I would not be his first option or maybe even the second,” Nani says. “I said: ‘No. I have been here for many years, I have been very important to this club and I think it’s time to decide.’ I wanted to play every game in the starting XI. ” And so Nani ended a fitful United career, marked by flashes of genius but defined by the feeling that he never delivered on his potential. He went on a   loan back to Sporting and then signed for Fenerbahce in July 2015 for £4. 25m. He took with him a reputation for flakiness and, if he had become trapped in a spiral of decline at United, there were few people in England to predict that he would rise again. Nani has risen again. In a rare interview, with the Guardian, the    can reflect on a £7. 2m transfer from Fenerbahce to Valencia and there is excitement before the start of La Liga. His new team kick off at home to Las Palmas on Monday night. But there is something else, something fundamental. The   Premier League champion and   Champions League winner describes it as the highlight of his career. He is now a European champion with Portugal. Nani enjoyed an outstanding tournament in France, scoring three and setting up one more. But there was particular resonance to a moment from the final against France. It came when Cristiano Ronaldo, the talisman and Nani’s     in Manchester, sat down on the turf with tears in his eyes. His game was over because of a knee injury and he looked for Nani to pass on the armband. It was the biggest game in Portuguese football history  —   never before had they won a major final  —   and from the 25th minute Nani would carry the captaincy and the responsibility for driving on the younger players like Raphaël Guerreiro, Renato Sanches and João Mario. Nani’s critics have said that he does not have the broadest of shoulders. Here, he led his country to glory. “It was a very strange feeling when Cristiano went off because I was very upset about losing our captain and our best player,” Nani says. “But very quickly I had to put my head up and try to help the team, try to give them the confidence and motivation to continue. I had to do my job. I had to do what captains have to do. “The thing that changed was that I was shouting to my players, to the younger players, giving them motivation. And it was fantastic. We deserved to win and it’s in history now. It’s something we’ll remember for ever. It’s    . ” After the substitute Eder’s   goal had secured the   win, Nani was overtaken by the emotion. The words tumble out now and there is hyperbole but the   impression is that the magnitude of the achievement has yet to sink in. The moments after the   whistle were a blur and Nani says he slept for “maybe one hour” that night, as he was so excited about getting back to Lisbon for the   bus parade. “It was the best thing of my career because it was for my country,” Nani adds. “Every player wants to win something for his country. It’s amazing how the Portuguese people lived this and the feeling that they gave to us when we got home was incredible. We proved a lot of doubters wrong. We drew our three group games but when it mattered the most, we were decisive. ” Nani has long been driven by the desire to prove people wrong from his childhood in Lisbon’s impoverished and   Amadora slum district, when he told his friends he would play for United and they were not convinced. “I remember watching United’s Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999 and, of course, when you watch teams like that, your dream is to play for them,” he says. “I said to my friends: ‘One day, I will play there.’ And the dream came true. If you believe and work hard, you can achieve your dreams. ” Nani won the Champions League in his first season at Old Trafford, coming on as an   substitute in the 2008 final against Chelsea and scoring with the fifth kick of the penalty shootout, which United edged in sudden death. He was voted their best player in the     season and he can look back on a clutch of spectacular goals. The ones that stand out for him are the smart finish against Liverpool in 2008 and the firecracker against Chelsea in 2011. Nani says “United gave me all that I have in this life” and his affection for Sir Alex Ferguson endures. “I see him like a father, angry and shouting at you one minute but in the next, patting his hand on your head and saying: ‘Come on, son.’ “It was hard to deal with at first, because you don’t know him and his strong ways but when you know him, you learn it is for your benefit. If today I have a strong mentality, it’s a lot to do with him. ” Perhaps Nani was frustrating at Old Trafford because his potential was so rich and, consequently, the bar was set so high. It is also true that he was not helped by the comparisons with Ronaldo, who had arrived at United from Sporting in 2003. “They were expecting me to be the next Ronaldo but that’s unfair,” he says. “We are different players, different personalities. Maybe it was a mistake to compare us. ” Nani moved in with Ronaldo for a month or so when he first arrived in Manchester and, disappointingly, he is not willing to reveal any of his friend’s bad habits. “We just had great moments,” he adds. “I needed somebody to help me to deal with things in Manchester and he was very important to me. ” The appraisal of Nani’s time at United is coloured negatively by the statistic that shows he started, on average, only 16 league games a season over his seven years. In   Ferguson’s final campaign and the one before Moyes, he had only seven starts in the league. “Maybe I could have played more games but the routine at that club, especially under Ferguson, was to alternate the players,” Nani says. “Everyone was part of the team. I played in big games and I played in not so big games. I played in finals. I had fantastic performances and I had not so great performances. This is football. “What I have in my mind is just the great moments I had in Manchester the fantastic goals that I scored against top teams. It’s what my friends remember and it’s what the fans remember, when they write to me. They don’t remember the bad things. ” Valencia have been keen to hype their new signing and have shot an   documentary entitled El Fenémeno de Nani. It might seem a little    but in reality he is a decorated former United player who has just helped his country to the European Championship. After his moment of triumph at Stade de France Nani said he thought about his journey to the top  —   from Amadora and the days at junior level when Portugal’s leading clubs would overlook him for being too small and skinny. He eventually changed Sporting’s opinion of him at a trial when he was 16. “Where I grew up it was very difficult for kids,” Nani says. “Some of them would go the wrong way  —   stealing, smoking, drugs and everything, but I never wanted to go that way. My way was that I was their friend, I saw them do the wrong things but I was with them. And, after, I go to play football. We had nothing when I was young. We were very poor but all my life I have been a fighter. I think that’s why I am here, because I will fight until the end. ”",nani could understand mind scrambl situat would affect physic portug winger given contract manchest unit septemb manag david moy join sport lisbon felt want readi fire higher level then moy play least hardli nani would start seven premier leagu game could best moment life turn worst nani say after sign contract like think peopl behind help opposit then stress come like cours injuri come moment someth made disappoint there fewer shade grey begin follow season moy successor loui gaal told want stay fight posit good would first option mayb even second nani say said mani year import club think time decid want play everi game start nani end fit unit career mark flash geniu defin feel never deliv potenti went loan back sport sign fenerbahc juli took reput flaki becom trap spiral declin unit peopl england predict would rise nani risen rare interview guardian reflect transfer fenerbahc valencia excit start liga team kick home palma monday night someth els someth fundament premier leagu champion champion leagu winner describ highlight career european champion portug nani enjoy outstand tournament franc score three set particular reson moment final franc came cristiano ronaldo talisman nani manchest turf tear eye game knee injuri look nani pass armband biggest game portugues footbal histori never major final minut nani would carri captainci respons drive younger player like rapha guerreiro renato sanch mario nani critic said broadest shoulder here countri glori strang feel cristiano went upset lose captain best player nani say quickli head help team give confid motiv continu captain thing chang shout player younger player give motiv fantast deserv histori someth rememb ever after substitut eder goal secur nani overtaken emot word tumbl hyperbol impress magnitud achiev sink moment whistl blur nani say slept mayb hour night excit get back lisbon parad best thing career countri nani add everi player want someth countri amaz portugues peopl live feel gave home incred prove doubter wrong drew three group game matter decis nani long driven desir prove peopl wrong childhood lisbon impoverish amadora slum district told friend would play unit convinc rememb watch unit champion leagu final bayern munich cours watch team like dream play say said friend play dream came true believ work hard achiev dream nani champion leagu first season trafford come substitut final chelsea score fifth kick penalti shootout unit edg sudden death vote best player season look back clutch spectacular goal one stand smart finish liverpool firecrack chelsea nani say unit gave life affect alex ferguson endur like father angri shout minut next pat hand head say come hard deal first know strong way know learn benefit today strong mental perhap nani frustrat trafford potenti rich consequ high also true help comparison ronaldo arriv unit sport they expect next ronaldo unfair say differ player differ person mayb mistak compar nani move ronaldo month first arriv manchest disappointingli will reveal friend habit great moment add need somebodi help deal thing manchest import apprais nani time unit colour neg statist show start averag leagu game season seven year ferguson final campaign moy seven start leagu mayb could play game routin club especi ferguson altern player nani say everyon part team play game play game play final fantast perform great perform thi footbal what mind great moment manchest fantast goal score team friend rememb fan rememb write they rememb thing valencia keen hype sign shot documentari entitl meno nani might seem littl realiti decor former unit player help countri european championship after moment triumph stade franc nani said thought journey amadora day junior level portug lead club would overlook small skinni eventu chang sport opinion trial where grew difficult kid nani say some would wrong steal smoke drug everyth never want friend wrong thing play footbal noth young poor life fighter think fight
111,Mexicans gave Donald Trump the hostile welcome he deserved,"Mexico was the focus of the global lens last week thanks to an unexpected and dreadful event: the visit of the most rude and unapologetic US presidential candidate in political history. Why did Donald Trump come here? It was the question that millions of Mexicans kept asking ourselves while saying, “You’re not welcome!” The Republican presidential candidate arrived in my country offering diplomacy as fake as a $3 bill. He knows that he’s not welcome and was aware of his rejection, by not just Mexico but all of Latin America, and the other countries and cultures he has offended. He has not only gathered the hate and distaste of the world, but with this visit to my country he has confirmed that he is without a doubt someone who cannot be trusted. You only have to look at the stunt that he pulled on his trip to Mexico: a charade to prove the unprovable  —   civility. Trump has built his campaign based on the saying “bad publicity is better than no publicity”. It is clear that Trump loves only ratings, not credibility. His campaign is a farce and he has been deceiving his followers since the beginning. But the biggest issue is that he handles information like a virus, which has sickened the American people. Trump has said that Mexican and Latin American migrants are the ones who bring guns, crime and drugs into the US, that we Mexicans are responsible for violence. But while he points with one hand to Mexico, with his other hand he encourages the American people to arm themselves  —   according to US government figures, seven out of 10 seized weapons in Mexico come from the United States. Trump proves with such statements that he doesn’t care about facts, he doesn’t care about reality. Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he’s completely ignorant or he’s lying. Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn’t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US. Nevertheless, a few hours later, he came out again saying that Mexico would pay for the wall, when our President Enrique Peña Nieto had said otherwise. This vile act offended not only a free and sovereign country, but his own voters as well. A guy like Trump cannot and will not show the minimum respect for anything, instead making a huge display of selfishness. He used the president of Mexico and all of the country’s citizens to his own benefit. Lies continue to gather  —   such as his support for the war in Iraq and the fact that he’s paying for his own campaign  —   and his denigration of women continues unabated. In my opinion, when someone who calls himself a leader turns out to be deceitful, it is a very low move. And yet he has stooped even lower, using the needs of his followers to validate himself with a speech full of intolerance, racism and fear. There is no way a nation could grow and prosper with no hope, values or responsibilities. History has proved that “leaderships” based on fear and ignorance are doomed to failure. I know that Trump is witnessing his own demise he’s aware that every poll is against him. In the middle of all this, he chose to come to Mexico so he could stop his ship sinking, in order to return to his own country and push on with his dishonest campaign. Well, even though I’m against walls, I’d gladly build one around Trump, to spare the world from people like him. We don’t need you.",mexico focu global len last week thank unexpect dread event visit rude unapologet presidenti candid polit histori donald trump come question million mexican kept ask say welcom republican presidenti candid arriv countri offer diplomaci fake bill know welcom awar reject mexico latin america countri cultur offend gather hate distast world visit countri confirm without doubt someon cannot trust look stunt pull trip mexico charad prove unprov civil trump built campaign base say public better public clear trump love rate credibl campaign farc deceiv follow sinc begin biggest issu handl inform like viru sicken american peopl trump said mexican latin american migrant one bring gun crime drug mexican respons violenc point hand mexico hand encourag american peopl accord govern figur seven seiz weapon mexico come unit state trump prove statement care fact care realiti instead keep spread distort point view suggest complet ignor lie last wednesday front camera choic recognis mexico commerci partner hard work mexican nevertheless hour later came say mexico would wall presid enriqu nieto said otherwis thi vile offend free sovereign countri voter well like trump cannot show minimum respect anyth instead make huge display selfish use presid mexico countri citizen benefit lie continu gather support iraq fact pay campaign denigr women continu unab opinion someon call leader turn deceit move stoop even lower use need follow valid speech full intoler racism fear there nation could grow prosper hope valu respons histori prove leadership base fear ignor doom failur know trump wit demis awar everi poll middl chose come mexico could stop ship sink order return countri push dishonest campaign well even though wall gladli build around trump spare world peopl like need
112,How to catch up on … Mr Robot,"As a network, USA has traditionally been the home of “blue sky” procedurals where there’s no problem that can’t be overcome in the span of 60 minutes. That’s why Mr Robot was a shock last summer. The gritty story of a hacker with a drug problem and mental health issues trying to take down capitalism by forgiving the world’s debt didn’t really make sense alongside the likes of the relatively    Royal Pains and Burn Notice. Thanks to buzz from SXSW, great reviews and a series of plot twists that kept the message boards guessing, Mr Robot became a hit for USA, winning two Golden Globes and becoming one of the most exciting shows on television.  But what if you missed out on the first 10 episodes? Well, they’re all streaming on Amazon Prime, so you could go watch them or you can find out everything you need to know below. Or maybe you watched it and just need a refresher before the new season starts on 13 July at 10pm EST. And, of course, spoilers are ahead, so if you don’t want to know what happened, shut down your computer now.  Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek): The unreliable narrator of the show, Elliot is a master hacker who works for AllSafe, a computer security firm that helps corporations protect themselves from people like Elliot. He has a penchant for illegal drugs mostly to keep his social anxiety and dissociative personality disorder in check. On the side, he uses his computer skills as a vigilante to help people, especially those who are close to him, like when he scares a married man away from dating his therapist.  The shady Mr Robot recruits him into fsociety, a group of hackers that want to use their powers to bring about the end of capitalism and take down E Corp (or Evil Corp, as Elliot and the rest of the characters on the show call it) which is also AllSafe’s biggest client. Elliot doesn’t always know what is happening because he suffers from blackouts and sometimes does things without being conscious of them.  Mr Robot (Christian Slater): A powerful hacker who lives in an abandoned amusement park in Coney Island, Mr Robot runs fsociety and wants nothing more than for everyone to be free from the shackles of debt and capitalism so that he can restart a sort of anarchic paradise. However Mr Robot isn’t real. He’s an embodiment of Elliot’s late father that only he can see, sort of like Tyler Durden in Fight Club.  Darlene Alderson (Carly Chaikin): The lead hacker of fsociety with connections to a powerful Chinese hacker collective Dark Army. She’s also Elliot’s sister. He doesn’t remember that, however, and tries to make out with her. It is gross.  Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday): Elliot’s best friend since childhood, they both lost a parent because of Evil Corp’s malfeasance. Angela is a salesperson at AllSafe and got Elliot his job there. She is the one who takes care of him, makes sure he is employed, fed and takes his medication. Because of her work at AllSafe, she’s within the orbit of Evil Corp, even though it was responsible for the death of her mother. She is getting very close with its CEO, who thinks of her as a protégé.  Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallström): The ambitious head of technology at Evil Corp with an equally ambitious wife. Tyrell will do anything (and anyone!) to get ahead, including murdering the CTO’s wife on the roof of Evil Corp during a company event. Because he is a suspect in her murder, he gets fired from the company and starts working with Elliot.  Elliot is recruited by Mr Robot to join fsociety and help bring down Evil Corp. They launch a DDoS attack that doesn’t destroy the company but frames Terry Colby, the CTO who was responsible for the deaths of Angela and Elliot’s parents.  Fsociety plans what they call the   Hack, a complicated operation that requires social engineering (aka breaking into Evil Corp headquarters) as well as a large number of hackers working in concert. Darlene gets in touch with the Dark Army, a group of Chinese cyberpunks, who help fsociety carry out the attack.  The problem is that Elliot doesn’t remember what happens in the days leading up to the attack. He wakes up in a car in a parking lot in Manhattan with no idea what happened during the previous three days. He does know that the hack was successful, that everyone’s debt has been erased, and the American markets are in complete chaos thanks to fsociety’s attack. Also Tyrell Wellick, who Elliot was working with, has disappeared in those three days and Elliot has no idea what happened to him.  The show has added a host of new characters to the lineup. Especially prominent will be Dominique DiPierro (Grace Gummer) an FBI agent on the hunt for the masterminds behind the   Hack. Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) the imperious leader of Evil Corp and Angela’s new mentor, and Joanna Wellick (Stephanie Corneliussen) Tyrell’s scheming wife, have been upgraded from recurring characters to series regulars. That means Angela’s focus won’t be on Elliot, but her place in Evil Corp and whether she can affect change at the company from within. Creator Sam Esmail, who directed all 10 episodes of this season, said at the Television Critics Association meeting this winter that he wants season two to focus on Elliot’s emotional journey. “For me, the headline for season two is: how do these two guys [Elliot and Mr Robot] reconcile? How does Elliot reconcile with the fact that he’s been seeing a delusion, a fantasy?” he said. Does that mean we’re going to find out that all sorts of things were delusions all along and other outrageous twists? I bet it does.

113,Oscar Pistorius removes prosthetic legs to walk at sentencing hearing,"Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympic and Olympic athlete, removed the prostheses he uses for walking and running in court on Wednesday in an effort to avoid a heavy jail sentence for killing his girlfriend with four shots from a 9mm handgun fired through a closed toilet door. Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, removed his prostheses and made his way unsteadily across the courtroom. On the third day of a sentencing hearing in the Gauteng high court in Pretoria, Barry Roux, who leads the former athlete’s defence team, said they wanted to show the court that Pistorius was not a “strong, ambitious man winning gold medals”. “I don’t want to overplay vulnerability   …     I don’t want to overplay disability   …     It doesn’t mean because he’s vulnerable that he can do what he likes. But please let’s understand   …     who is this man that you must sentence?” Roux said. The state prosecutor Gerry Nel told the trial judge Thokozile Masipa that it was her duty to impose at least the 15 years prescribed as a minimum sentence for murder in South Africa “despite any personal doubts” she might have. Pistorius was released on bail last year after serving 10 months of a   sentence for culpable homicide, the equivalent of manslaughter in English law. His conviction was subsequently upgraded to murder by the supreme court of appeal. Masipa will now sentence the former athlete for the more serious crime.  Nel said any sentence needed to consider the needs of the community and send a strong message to deter violent crime. South Africa has some of the highest levels of murder in the world. “I cannot think of a more excessive use of a firearm than   …    . firing four shots through that doorway,” said Nel, whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism. “Murder remains the most reprehensible crime   …     Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed. We argue for   imprisonment. ”   Pistorius won global fame and fortune by reaching the   of the 400m sprint in the London Olympics of 2012 and landing a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with major brands.  The    was nicknamed the “blade runner” a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete, and hailed as a role model for disabled people all over the world. He killed Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, in the early hours of 14 February 2013 at his home in Pretoria.  The subsequent trial showed a darker side to the athlete, revealing a taste for guns and fast cars. Pistorius remained slumped with his head in his hands through much of Wednesday’s hearings.  The case has gripped South Africa and prompted fierce global interest. Relatives of both Pistorius and Steenkamp have attended the court, sitting within metres of each other. Both sides have sought to sway Masipa with hours of legal arguments and testimony which have seen moments of intense emotion.  On Tuesday, the father of the victim wept as he told the court said that though, with great difficulty, he had forgiven Pistorius, the former athlete should “pay” for what he had done. In emotional testimony, Barry Steenkamp described how his family had been devastated by the murder.  “I think of her every day. I talk to her. It is difficult to explain. What happened devastated us. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody in the world,” Steenkamp, 73, said. Nel told the court on Wednesday that “forgiveness has more to do with the person who is forgiving than the person who committed the crime”. “There is still that need for a sentence according to the crime that is committed,” Nel said. Earlier in the week, the court heard from a psychologist who said Pistorius was suffering serious depression, anxiety and   stress syndrome.  Roux, appearing for Pistorius, told the court on Wednesday that the former athlete had already “punished himself”. “[He] will punish himself for the rest of his life far more than any court of law can punish him. He paid from the moment he fired the shot. He has lost his future, losing his loved one. He is a broken man. He has paid financially. He has paid socially   …     He is filled with  . He has paid constantly,” Roux said. State prosecutors initially accused Pistorius of killing his girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage after an argument at his luxurious home in a gated community in Pretoria. Roux said this “incorrect version” had been rejected during the trial and should not be allowed to influence any sentence. “The accused never intended to kill the deceased,” he told the court.  Much of the legal argument around the killing has centred on whether Pistorius should have foreseen the likelihood of the death of whoever was in the cubicle when he opened fire. The former athlete has repeatedly said he thought an intruder had broken into the home and was hiding there. Nel successfully applied for the removal of a court ban imposed on the publication of graphic images of the wounds inflicted on Steenkamp. He also said that an interview given by Pistorius to ITV, the British television network, due to be broadcast after legal proceedings end, was “disrespectful”. Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the former sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives following this week’s hearing.  He might however be able to apply for medical parole, once sentenced.  Masipa said she would announce the sentence next month.",oscar pistoriu south african paralymp olymp athlet remov prosthes use walk run court wednesday effort avoid heavi jail sentenc kill girlfriend four shot handgun fire close toilet door pistoriu whose lower leg amput month remov prosthes made unsteadili across courtroom third sentenc hear gauteng high court pretoria barri roux lead former athlet defenc team said want show court pistoriu strong ambiti win gold medal want overplay vulner want overplay disabl mean vulner like pleas understand must sentenc roux said state prosecutor gerri told trial judg thokozil masipa duti impos least year prescrib minimum sentenc murder south africa despit person doubt might pistoriu releas bail last year serv month sentenc culpabl homicid equival manslaught english convict subsequ upgrad murder suprem court appeal masipa sentenc former athlet seriou crime said sentenc need consid need commun send strong messag deter violent crime south africa highest level murder world cannot think excess firearm fire four shot doorway said whose belliger style attract prais critic murder remain reprehens crime societi demand appropri sentenc impos argu imprison pistoriu global fame fortun reach sprint london olymp land seri lucr sponsorship deal major brand nicknam blade runner refer carbon fibr prosthet use compet hail role model disabl peopl world kill reeva steenkamp graduat model earli hour februari home pretoria subsequ trial show darker side athlet reveal tast gun fast car pistoriu remain slump head hand much wednesday hear case grip south africa prompt fierc global interest rel pistoriu steenkamp attend court sit within metr both side sought sway masipa hour legal argument testimoni seen moment intens emot tuesday father victim wept told court said though great difficulti forgiven pistoriu former athlet done emot testimoni barri steenkamp describ famili devast murder think everi talk difficult explain what happen devast wish anybodi world steenkamp said told court wednesday forgiv person forgiv person commit crime there still need sentenc accord crime commit said earlier week court heard psychologist said pistoriu suffer seriou depress anxieti stress syndrom roux appear pistoriu told court wednesday former athlet alreadi punish punish rest life court punish paid moment fire shot lost futur lose love broken paid financi paid social fill paid constantli roux said state prosecutor initi accus pistoriu kill girlfriend jealou rage argument luxuri home gate commun pretoria roux said incorrect version reject trial allow influenc sentenc accus never intend kill deceas told court much legal argument around kill centr whether pistoriu foreseen likelihood death whoever cubicl open fire former athlet repeatedli said thought intrud broken home hide success appli remov court impos public graphic imag wound inflict steenkamp also said interview given pistoriu british televis network broadcast legal proceed disrespect legal expert extrem unlik former sportsman abl challeng sentenc receiv follow week hear might howev abl appli medic parol sentenc masipa said would announc sentenc next month
114,"Architect, 52, falls to death from New York skyscraper","Authorities are investigating the death of an architect who fell after apparently becoming dizzy while working on the roof of a New York skyscraper. Bruno Travalja, 52, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, died on Thursday afternoon after falling from the roof of the   building in Manhattan, police said on Saturday. Travalja took off a harness and knelt down to take some measurements, then became dizzy and fell, they said. The New York Daily News, which reached his wife, reported that he was the owner of Crowne Architectural Systems in North Bergen, New Jersey. Alexis Travalja said she and her husband started the firm that builds windows and curtain walls in their basement 11 years ago. “He was the most honest,   truthful human being who ever walked the face of the planet. It was a tragic accident,” she said. No one could be reached at the firm, which was closed on Saturday. Alexis Travalja said her husband had attended Pratt Institute, a private college known for its architecture program, and that he had later worked on a building there. They had three children. Police said Travalja fell on a   landing between 52nd and 53rd streets and suffered severe trauma to his body. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

115,Kickers set NFL record with 11 missed extra-points on chaotic afternoon,"NFL kickers missed like never before on Sunday, setting a record with 11 failed extra point attempts. Kickers missed left, right, had kicks blocked and hit the uprights. Kickers missed in the wind and indoors. With several games left, kickers already had the most misses in one week since the NFL merger. The NFL moved   attempts back before last season because the kicks had become routine, and professionals almost never missed. The   attempt became a  . In Week 13 of last season, kickers missed eight. That mark was eclipsed by   Sunday. Cincinnati’s Mike Nugent and Robbie Gould of the New York Giants each missed two   attempts. Chicago’s Connor Barth, Minnesota’s Kai Forbath, Jacksonville’s Jason Myers, Cleveland’s Cody Parkey and New England’s Stephen Gostkowski each missed one. Seattle’s Steven Hauschka and Detroit’s Matt Prater had kicks blocked. Barth and Gould were kicking in gusty winds in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Forbath, Myers and Prater all missed despite being indoors. “It was much windier than it usually is,” Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie said. “It was a   from our bench to theirs, then it switched toward the end of the game diagonal from our tunnel to the opposite tunnel. ” Forbath had just replaced the ineffective Blair Walsh as Minnesota’s kicker this week. In the   games, Nugent’s misses arguably had the biggest impact. The Bengals lost   to the Buffalo Bills and drove all the way to Buffalo’s   line in the closing seconds. If Nugent hadn’t missed those two   attempts, the Bengals could have attempted a   field goal at the end of the game rather than unsuccessfully trying to score a touchdown.",kicker miss like never sunday set record fail extra point attempt kicker miss left right kick block upright kicker miss wind indoor with sever game left kicker alreadi miss week sinc merger move attempt back last season kick becom routin profession almost never miss attempt becam week last season kicker miss eight that mark eclips sunday cincinnati mike nugent robbi gould york giant miss attempt chicago connor barth minnesota forbath jacksonvil jason myer cleveland codi parkey england stephen gostkowski miss seattl steven hauschka detroit matt prater kick block barth gould kick gusti wind east rutherford jersey forbath myer prater miss despit indoor much windier usual giant long snapper deossi said bench switch toward game diagon tunnel opposit tunnel forbath replac ineffect blair walsh minnesota kicker week game nugent miss arguabl biggest impact bengal lost buffalo bill drove buffalo line close second nugent miss attempt bengal could attempt field goal game rather unsuccess tri score touchdown
116,Would Zlatan Ibrahimovic ever choose Philadelphia Union over LA Galaxy?,"If MLS was ever looking for a prospective new signing to herald as their very own LeBron James, trailing his decision over which team he will be taking his talents to next, they might have found one in Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The striker last week confirmed his exit from Paris   and clubs in England, Italy and China are presenting their cases to the Swede. But reports suggest he is instead on his way to North America. Ibrahimovic could milk this even more than James ever did. When linked with a player of Ibrahimovic’s stature certain MLS clubs tend to be named. The LA Galaxy are one such club, with Bruce Arena’s side demonstrating why they could use the former Barcelona striker in their   draw at PPL Park last week. It was somewhat fitting that at such a juncture of speculation that the Galaxy faced the Philadelphia Union on Wednesday night, because if they are to dare to go for Zlatan they must go through them. The Union confirmed following the emergence of an image on social media that at one point or another not so long ago they had held the discovery rights for the   . But will we ever see the Swede running out for Philly? Well, the short answer seems to be no   and that’s coming from the club. On Saturday, Union coach Jim Curtin admitted their interest in the Swede is tactical more than anything (ESPN reports that if Ibrahimovic does sign for another MLS team then Philly would be owed $50, 000). “Is there a strategic move to have him on there? Possibly,” Curtin said. “You look at different things and different mechanisms that our league has, different unique ways that players come into our league  —   [there are] ways you can be rewarded if you’re a little bit out in front of things. ” Of course, every team in MLS could use a player of Ibrahimovic’s quality, but Saturday’s   draw between the Union and Montreal at Stade Saputo showed why the Philadelphia Union  —   with CJ Sapong leading the line as an improvised and slightly out of sorts    —   need the striker more than most. Whether they sign him or not, the club are likely to be on the frontline in the fight. With the signing of Ibrahimovic the Galaxy would boast undoubtedly the most illustrious frontline in MLS history. Hurdles must be leapt over before they can make their move for the Swede, with Robbie Keane, Giovani Dos Santos and Steven Gerrard already signed to DP deals and Targeted Allocation money already used to sign Nigel De Jong and Jelle Van Damme. A space would have to be cleared. Wherever Ibrahimovic goes, a space needs to be cleared. GR, New York City FC are tied for first place in the Eastern Conference. The Portland Timbers are just one point away from the Western Conference cellar. No, this isn’t the beginning of a Rod Serling narrative. This is as real as NYC FC’s victory over the Timbers on Sunday. Now, your take on the match really depends on your point of view. For Caleb Porter, manager of the defending MLS Cup champions, it was a painful experience. “This is about as cruel a game as I have been a part of. We dominated the game, start to finish. The pressure, possession, chance creation   we dominated,” he said.  And he is right. As Patrick Vieira admitted post match, conceding possession was not part of his gameplan. The Portland Timbers were just that good. But the larger narrative emerging from Sunday night’s encounter is the complete turnaround of New York City FC under Vieira. Were NYC FC lucky? Sure. Just look at the blatant   on the handball that led to their first goal. However, if this match had been played in 2015, NYC FC would have lost. There is no reason NYC FC should have won on Sunday. Not the way Portland played. However, City’s dogged determination, disciplined performance and team unity has propelled them to their third straight victory  —   a feat the team has only achieved one other time in their brief history. Vieira plays a major part in that achievement, particularly in harnessing the club’s fighting mentality. “The first year will be hard for any team that comes in, but now we beat the defending champions,” Mix Diskerud said. “When you see this past month and see us as a team, [we are] a group that is willing to fight together, and do whatever it takes to get the W. ” That was a sentiment echoed by team captain, David Villa. “In any league in the world, you can play good, you can take quality players, good defense, good goalkeeping, but if you don’t fight for every ball, if minute by minute you are fighting with your   against your other teammates, you are dead,” he said. “The team understood this three to four games ago and [the results are] very nice for us. ” Are NYC FC for real? Only time will tell. But for now, one thing is certain  —   they are better. And that is on Vieira. The way the New York Red Bulls were talking prior to their match against DC United, you would think the denizens of the District were the most hated people on Earth. But following a thorough   loss at RFK, perhaps that talk was simply New York reminding themselves of how they should feel. While the New   rivalry is filled with rich history and contentious battles, the most heated of those encounters remain far in the past  —   particularly from the Red Bulls’ perspective. Recent history has been solidly on the side of New York, who have taken four of the past six “Atlantic Cup” trophies while eliminating DC from the playoffs in two consecutive seasons. That has created a noticable complacency in recent matches  —   a trend which became all the more apparent in contrast to the Red Bulls’   matches against New York City FC last season. The Red Bulls were sleep walking through their assignments to start the match on Friday, allowing DC to spring into action. Another   centerback pairing in Chris Duvall and Aurelien Collin was left exposed with a perfect through ball to the feet of Patrick Nyarko. With space and time on his side, the Ghanaian midfielder comfortably served the ball across the area to Red Bull killer Alvaro Saborio for the early lead. DC doubled the lead just shy of halftime, winning the ball off of lazy possession from Mike Grella, springing two uncontested passes that ended with a goal from Nyarko. One would think New York would find inspiration at the half, being down to their historic rivals in such inauspicious fashion. Instead, it was DC with a nose for goal in the final stanza. New York’s response? Well, that came in the form of apologies after the match. “I just need to apologize to the fans for that performance,” said Red Bulls skipper Dax McCarty. “It’s one of the most embarrassing performances I’ve been a part of since I’ve been at this club. There’s no excuse for it. It’s sad in a rivalry game, to let them off the hook like that and not be up for the challenge. Red Bull boss Jesse Marsch assumed “the load of responsibility” for the team’s listless performance as well. “We came into a rivalry game, one that we knew would require a team that was always up for the competition and for the night, and we came up zero for 11 on that. ” This isn’t meant to take away from the performance of DC. Ben Olsen  —   a veteran of the   wars  —   had his players prepared to take on their hated rival, and Travis Worra made some spectacular saves early in the match to keep his team ahead. But the motivation on both sides was clear. In other words, DC got it. “It’s a rivalry,” DC United’s Sean Franklin said after the match. “They’re a team that we hate and they hate us. ” On Friday night, only half of that statement rang true. DM, They say a week is a long time in soccer, and it’s an even longer time if you’re Kei Kamara. In that time the Sierra Leone forward managed to have a blazing   row with a   one Saturday, then secure a trade and start for his news side the following Saturday. Kamara’s possessions are probably still sitting in a   truck somewhere in Columbus, but he has already demonstrated the difference he will make for the New England Revolution. Of course, there was perhaps little surprise in the impact Kamara made for Jay Heaps’ side in the   home win over the Chicago Fire. He finished as MLS’s top goalscorer last season, finding the net 26 times as the Columbus Crew made a run all the way to MLS Cup. Had it not been for a certain Atomic Ant carrying an entire team, franchise and the CN Tower on his back, Kamara would have been 2015’s MVP.  Against Chicago Kamara demonstrated his quality from the start,   the Revolution’s ailing frontline and recording six shots on goal (no New England player has tallied that many shots in a match all season). There was an energy to the Revs’ performance that has been lacking for quite some time, and that was down to Kamara. His signing could be a   moment for his new team. Kamara has been painted as the pantomime villain in some quarters over his behaviour at Columbus this season, but he did have justifiable grounds for complaint. The Crew should have handed the forward a Designated Player deal much sooner than they did, with the relationship between the two parties already damaged by the time pen was put to paper. Maybe he was right to feel undervalued. Greg Berhalter and Columbus feel they got the better of the deal that sent Kamara to New England, but even at 32 he is a   and a  . “I want to thank Columbus, obviously,” Lee Nguyen joked after the win over Chicago. “[Kei’s a] great addition. He’s so smart, so athletic, and he wins everything. You’re going to have to watch him. It adds another dynamic to our attack. ” Indeed, the Revolution have a lot to thank Columbus for. Heaps should probably add Berhalter to his Christmas card list. GR, Glance at the standings in the Western Conference and one team stands out as the 2016 season’s surprise package so far   the Colorado Rapids. Often the league’s most tediously tragic side last season, the Rapids have become this year’s unlikely frontrunners, staying top of the table despite Saturday’s   road draw against the Columbus Crew. And yet at Mapfre Stadium there were fleeting signs for apprehension as far the visitors were concerned. Not so long ago Pablo Mastroeni was the subject for much criticism over his team selectios. They were seemingly made by pulling balls randomly out of a hat. The former USA international midfielder experienced some sort of realisation over the   though, and things have been very different this term. In a sense, perhaps a little too different. Mastroeni has stuck with the same starting lineup for much of the season, giving the Rapids a sense of stability and consistency that has been central to Colorado’s streak. However, that means squad rotation has been minimal, with the first signs of fatigue and stagnation coming in the draw against the Columbus Crew on Saturday evening. The Rapids looked completely sapped of energy late on at Columbus, with their frontline suffering most. They were slow in thought and action, with the Crew making the most of their opportunity to claim a point against the league leaders. There are a lot of players on Mastroeni’s team who have played a lot of minutes and it showed. Mastroeni should have seen this coming. Saturday’s fixture was the final leg of a stretch that saw the Colorado Rapids play three games over just eight days. They stuck with largely the same   for much of that run, with the Colorado boss also reluctant to use his substitutes to refresh his side even when they are so blatantly flagging. All this points to a coach with little   in what he has achieved this season, stumbling across something so successful he is now fearful of deviating from it. What’s more, the Rapids have options  —   like Dillon Powers and Dillion Serna  —   who Mastroeni is currently overlooking. The Colorado boss has enjoyed an unprecedented start to 2016, but now he must recognise what is needed to maintain it.

117,Soweto uprising 40 years on: the image that shocked the world,"The sky above was dark with smoke. At the railway station, as Ntsiki Makhubo and her mother returned from a day in Johannesburg, they were met by an anxious crowd. As they stepped down from the train, they trod on shattered glass and heard the news. Your brother has been shot and killed, Makhubo was told. When South African police opened fire on marching schoolchildren in the township of Soweto on 16 June 1976, Makhubo’s neighbours had seen her older brother,    Mbuyisa Makhubo, drenched in blood and staggering to a clinic, carrying a limp boy in his arms. They assumed he had been gravely hurt. In fact, it was the    boy Mbuyisa had scooped up in the midst of the chaos who lost his life that day. His name was Hector Pieterson. A photograph of the two taken by a local journalist was printed first by a local newspaper, and then around the world. It would go on to have a huge impact, prompting global outrage at the police’s brutality, becoming an iconic image of the struggle against a hated racist system and prompting a new wave of protest that would eventually lead to the end of apartheid. Today, South Africa commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Soweto uprising, as that day is now known. No one knows exactly how many people died  —   estimates range from 150 to 700 during the months of subsequent violence. But the anniversary  —   like the famous photograph  —   will provoke a variety of reactions, not all of them easily reconciled. “The uprising means different things for different people,” says Khwezi Gule, chief curator of the Hector Pieterson museum and memorial in Soweto. “There are different generations and varying constituencies. Even those who were there in 1976 were affected differently: parents, students, leaders, people just caught in the crossfire. ”  Much attention has been focused on Pieterson and the screaming girl in the picture, his younger sister Antoinette. Both were pupils at local schools and were marching to protest against the introduction of compulsory tuition in Afrikaans, seen as just one more humiliation for students crammed into deliberately overcrowded,   schools designed to deny, rather than provide, education to South Africa’s black majority. There were deeper factors too. A new generation had lost faith in its political leaders, who were mostly in jail or exile, and many were contemptuous of parents who they thought had accepted apartheid’s humiliating restrictions.  Pieterson, although not particularly politically aware, had joined his school friends to march through the dirt streets of the sprawling township to a local stadium. Police blocked their way. A standoff followed. Stones began to fly. Teargas filled the air. Then the shooting started. “There was confusion. I saw people hiding themselves and then I hid myself too. I was afraid because I didn’t know where Hector had gone to . .. then I moved forward and I   …     saw Hector’s shoe,” Antoinette remembered 15 years later.  It was then that Mbuyisa Makhubo picked up the boy and began to run. There was little point  —   he was dead before he reached the nearest hospital. But if the Pieterson family were shattered by the events that day, the Makhubo family were soon to suffer too for Umbiswa’s impulsive act of kindness. The family had already paid a heavy price for their involvement in the   struggle. Key African National Congress (ANC) leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu had been family friends before being jailed, and the Makhubos were well known to authorities. Mbuyisa, his other two brothers and sister Ntsiki were frequent visitors at Mandela’s Soweto home where Winnie, his second wife, sometimes cooked for them. “She also helped me register for college,” Ntsiki said. “We used to go over and eat there: spinach and pap [maize flour mash] or sometimes grilled meat. ” Mbuyisa’s father had joined the Umkhonto we Sizwe organisation (MK) which waged a campaign of sabotage and violence within South Africa in the early 1960s. Forced to flee to avoid prison, he lived in ANC camps in neighbouring countries before dying in 1973 in Kenya. Within days of the Soweto uprising of 16 June, it became clear that Mbuyisa would follow his father into uncertain exile. “I was very close to my brother. After that day, when he had carried the boy, he was disturbed, distressed. He was harassed all the time by police and journalists. Eventually he said, ‘I have to go’ and I packed him a small bag and he left for the border, to Botswana. He wrote for a while but after five years, the letters stopped. We never saw him again,” Ntsiki said.  Recently, there have been reports that Mbuyisa has been found in Canada, but no firm identification has been made and Ntsiki remains sceptical.  The family were to suffer more over the coming years as the government intensified its brutal efforts to maintain the apartheid system in the face of massive opposition, economic crisis and international opprobrium.  In 1985, it was the turn of another Makhubo son to flee: Ntsiki’s second brother. He also joined MK and left South Africa for training as a guerrilla fighter. He remained in exile until the ANC took power and Nelson Mandela became president in 1994, but died of Aids five years after returning to his homeland.  Since then, the fortunes of the Makhubo family have steadily improved  —   like those of their nation. Though Ntsiki herself still lives in the rundown   house on Litabe Street  —   from which her brother set out 40 years ago to join a march  —   her own children have grown up knowing relative peace. Two of them live in Cape Town, where one is a university student and the other is a supermarket manager. The third, Zongezile, a stylish    still lives in Soweto, where he runs a tourism  .  For Zongezile, the commemoration of 1976 sends an important message. “The memory of Hector Pieterson and my uncle means sacrifice and selflessness, but it also means change,” he said. Soweto itself is certainly transforming. There are car dealerships, new roads and bus stations, and shopping malls with major western brands. An influx of tourists to the area around the site of Hector Pieterson’s killing  —   now marked with a signboard  —   has prompted a   of souvenir shops and restaurants serving “authentic” Soweto cuisine. The Hector Pieterson museum opened in 2002 and now has 90, 000 visitors a year. Many are schoolchildren and students, who smile and pose in front of the picture of Mbuyisa carrying the dying boy. Few of these youngsters who visit know much of the uprising, nor are they particularly interested. “I’d say out of the 40 or 50 school kids I usually take round the museum in any one group, you’ll have three or four who either know something or engage,” said Liz Block, a lecturer and volunteer tour guide. Ntsiki is concerned by this lack of knowledge, and fears violence might return. She was horrified when dozens of protesting mineworkers were shot dead by police near Johannesburg in 2012, and by a series of recent brutal clearances of squatter camps. “Was the sacrifice worth it? There are a lot of positive things no doubt. A lot has been done. I am proud to be a South African. But I am still saddened. There is much that is wrong. People are still being gunned down in squatter camps when they protest. We didn’t fight for that,” she said.  In parts of Soweto too, deep poverty remains. In some areas families are crammed into   hostel housing. In others, poor immigrants from rural areas or neighbouring countries rent tin shacks for £25 a month. The contrast with the touristy areas of Orlando West, let alone the wealthy suburbs of Johannesburg only a   drive away, is striking.  In Kliptown, on the   fringe of the township, 45, 000 people live on dusty streets without access to schools or jobs. The area suffers from endemic drug abuse and violent crime. Angry community leaders talk of betrayal by their elected representatives.  “The government and politicians will come by for the celebration, do their campaign, host their events, but it has nothing to do with us,” said Bob Nameng, who runs a local community programme. But Zongezile Makhubo insists that, despite all the problems facing South Africa and Soweto 40 years after the uprising, he is hopeful. “Some here overlook the good we have achieved in the years of democracy and just look at the problems,” he said. “But we have shown that our country unites to face the challenges. Everyone comes together and says we must do what we can to help and that this is the country we love. ”",dark smoke railway station ntsiki makhubo mother return johannesburg anxiou crowd step train trod shatter glass heard news your brother shot kill makhubo told when south african polic open fire march schoolchildren township soweto june makhubo neighbour seen older brother mbuyisa makhubo drench blood stagger clinic carri limp arm they assum grave hurt fact mbuyisa scoop midst chao lost life name hector pieterson photograph taken local journalist print first local newspap around world would huge impact prompt global outrag polic brutal becom icon imag struggl hate racist system prompt wave protest would eventu lead apartheid today south africa commemor anniversari soweto upris known know exactli mani peopl die estim rang month subsequ violenc anniversari like famou photograph provok varieti reaction easili reconcil upris mean differ thing differ peopl say khwezi gule chief curat hector pieterson museum memori soweto there differ gener vari constitu even affect differ parent student leader peopl caught crossfir much attent focus pieterson scream girl pictur younger sister antoinett both pupil local school march protest introduct compulsori tuition afrikaan seen humili student cram deliber overcrowd school design deni rather provid educ south africa black major there deeper factor gener lost faith polit leader mostli jail exil mani contemptu parent thought accept apartheid humili restrict pieterson although particularli polit awar join school friend march dirt street sprawl township local stadium polic block standoff follow stone began tearga fill then shoot start there confus peopl hide afraid know hector gone move forward hector shoe antoinett rememb year later mbuyisa makhubo pick began there littl point dead reach nearest hospit pieterson famili shatter event makhubo famili soon suffer umbiswa impuls kind famili alreadi paid heavi price involv struggl african nation congress leader nelson mandela walter sisulu famili friend jail makhubo well known author mbuyisa brother sister ntsiki frequent visitor mandela soweto home winni second wife sometim cook also help regist colleg ntsiki said use spinach maiz flour mash sometim grill meat mbuyisa father join umkhonto sizw organis wage campaign sabotag violenc within south africa earli forc flee avoid prison live camp neighbour countri die kenya within day soweto upris june becam clear mbuyisa would follow father uncertain exil close brother after carri disturb distress harass time polic journalist eventu said pack small left border botswana wrote five year letter stop never ntsiki said recent report mbuyisa found canada firm identif made ntsiki remain sceptic famili suffer come year govern intensifi brutal effort maintain apartheid system face massiv opposit econom crisi intern opprobrium turn anoth makhubo flee ntsiki second brother also join left south africa train guerrilla fighter remain exil took power nelson mandela becam presid die aid five year return homeland sinc fortun makhubo famili steadili improv like nation though ntsiki still live rundown hous litab street brother year join march children grown know rel peac live cape town univers student supermarket manag third zongezil stylish still live soweto run tourism zongezil commemor send import messag memori hector pieterson uncl mean sacrific selfless also mean chang said soweto certainli transform there dealership road station shop mall major western brand influx tourist area around site hector pieterson kill mark signboard prompt souvenir shop restaur serv authent soweto cuisin hector pieterson museum open visitor year mani schoolchildren student smile pose front pictur mbuyisa carri die youngster visit know much upris particularli interest school kid usual take round museum group three four either know someth engag said block lectur volunt tour guid ntsiki concern lack knowledg fear violenc might return horrifi dozen protest minework shot dead polic near johannesburg seri recent brutal clearanc squatter camp sacrific worth there posit thing doubt done proud south african still sadden there much wrong peopl still gun squatter camp protest fight said part soweto deep poverti remain area famili cram hostel hous other poor immigr rural area neighbour countri rent shack month contrast touristi area orlando west alon wealthi suburb johannesburg drive away strike kliptown fring township peopl live dusti street without access school job area suffer endem drug abus violent crime angri commun leader talk betray elect repres govern politician come celebr campaign host event noth said nameng run local commun programm zongezil makhubo insist despit problem face south africa soweto year upris hope some overlook good achiev year democraci look problem said shown countri unit face challeng everyon come togeth say must help countri love
118,How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?,"In January, I wrote: “In the first 26 days of this year, 186 political polls were released. ” Since then, I’ve lost count.  New numbers are released every day by different organizations (some academic, some corporate and some media businesses themselves) and they all depict a slightly different political reality.  To state the obvious, in 2016 political reality is very different from that of previous presidential elections. And not just because the two remaining candidates are the least popular for more than 30 years. It’s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all. In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the Economist and YouGov found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the LA Times and USC Tracking put Donald Trump 4% ahead.  Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.  This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the average.  The site Real Clear Politics (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45. 9% of the vote while Trump has 43. 8% meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2. 1%.  Notice how Democrats aren’t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It’s because 2. 1% means nothing. It’s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It’s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote.  The takeaway? Going into tonight’s debate, the two candidates are neck and neck.  But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has pointed out, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).  So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.

119,Donald Trump’s latest trick: turning Mike Pence into media catnip,"Donald Trump has done the impossible: he has made Mike Pence interesting. The governor of Indiana, a social conservative, looks like a politician from central casting, a   Hoosier who might sit silently behind any president through any State of the Union speech. In recent weeks, as the Trump veepstakes dragged on, he stayed relentlessly scripted, perpetually  . Next to the other finalists, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, he lacked star power. He lacked pizzazz. Then, with an existential crisis more worthy of a candidate for prince of Denmark than president of the United States, Trump changed all that. After news of Pence’s choice leaked on Thursday afternoon, first to Roll Call and then confirmed to at least a dozen other outlets including the Guardian, Trump suddenly insisted that it wasn’t a “final, final decision”. He prevaricated in TV interviews and canceled his scheduled VP announcement in order to pay tribute to the victims of the truck attack in Nice.  Through it all, and a round trip on a private jet from Indiana to New York on Thursday, Pence remained silent. The clock, however, was ticking. Pence had until noon on Friday to withdraw from his   campaign in Indiana, or else be ineligible to run for   under state law. Sensing this, his rivals for VP tossed out fiery rhetoric, in an attempt to convince Trump to change his mind.  Most strikingly, Gingrich went on Fox News to say: “We should, frankly, test every person here who is of a Muslim background and if they believe in sharia, they should be deported. ” This all added immense drama to what otherwise would have been a relatively dull process. Pence was the safe pick, but instead of a strategic leak the night before an announcement then safely confirmed by the campaign, there began a dramatic “he said, she said” news story, full of twists and turns.  Eventually, just before 11am on Friday, Trump tweeted that he had chosen Pence. The crisis was resolved. Apparently. But on Saturday morning at a midtown Manhattan hotel, Trump still delivered a strikingly unorthodox rollout. The billionaire took the stage just after 11am and delivered a nearly       monologue.  Pence was barely mentioned. Trump talked extensively about himself, bragging that “no one in the history of this country has known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump” and even insisting that “school choice is where it’s at, folks”. He weighed in on the coup attempt in Turkey, saying: “As far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people, we wish them well. It looks like they are resolving the difficulty but we wish them well, a lot of anguish last night but hopefully it will all work out. ”  He also attacked Hillary Clinton and bragged that he had predicted the result of the British referendum on whether to leave the European Union. “I think it was a win for them,” he said. It was bizarre  —   and, sure enough, it grabbed the media’s attention. Most presidential candidates introducing a running mate deliver a paean to their chosen one. Trump talked about every topic under the sun, occasionally mentioning Pence but then digressing.  Eventually, the Indiana governor took the stage. Trump quickly left it. There wasn’t even time for a decent picture of the two men embracing. Left on his own, Pence gave a solid but unspectacular speech. He hit all the right notes but with no flights of fancy, no moments of inspiration.

120,William Tyler: Modern Country review – Americana too sublime for words,"American guitarist William Tyler’s excellent fourth album begins with an anxiety attack and ends with an interpolation of Dire Straits’ Sultans of Swing so subtle, I’m still not sure it’s there. The instrumental album strung between those two poles is of such eloquence it renders them superfluous. Context almost gets in the way. Modern Country is a beatific and expansive ambient record daubed in acoustic and electric guitars, analogue oscillations, some really scary bells and no words its meaning can be fluid. But, as Tyler tells it, the album came about when this former member of Lambchop and Silver Jews  —   latterly celebrated for his lyrical acoustic fingerpicking  —  had a panic attack on an interstate. Touring musicians can’t afford such phobias Tyler turned disaster into opportunity, taking the roads less travelled. It was an enforced slowdown soundtracked by country music and the German motorik of the 70s, the sine qua non of driving music. Both traditions, alongside   and Knopfler, find their way onto this lush study of Americana that thrums with a love of the South, a place not synonymous, Tyler argues, with the worst of its past. Kingdom of Jones, a roiling, bright fingerpicked raga, bears witness to Jones County, Mississippi, a historically   enclave. The vanishing America of truck stops and   towns is a cliche now, its bleakness long riffed on in films, photography and song. But Tyler’s parents come from small Southern places, and he returned to a cabin in their university town to write this set of spacious songs, where tradition and transcendence mix. Albion Moonlight reverberates with twang, but behind the guitars, it sounds like someone is working sheet metal next door. The Great Unwind  —   the album’s heroic closer  —   takes its name from New Yorker writer George Packer’s celebrated 2013 account of American inequality. You want to punch the air at the unexpected electric guitar solo. Midway through, there are roughly 30 seconds of undiluted birdsong. Highway Anxiety, meanwhile, betrays no fear, as though Tyler wrote it to soothe himself. The bittersweet melody, the   chord progressions, the sense of acceptance  —   it’s all succour, designed to make your blood pressure drop. Just shy of three minutes in, Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche’s kit rattles into life and Tyler’s awesome band (completed by bassist Darin Gray (Jim O’Rourke, Tweedy) and Justin Vernon associate Phil Cook on keyboards) slip into gear, the austere acoustic framework of Tyler’s previous album, 2013’s also excellent Impossible Truth, receding into the   mirror.",american guitarist william tyler excel fourth album begin anxieti attack end interpol dire strait sultan swing subtl still sure instrument album strung pole eloqu render superflu context almost get modern countri beatif expans ambient record daub acoust electr guitar analogu oscil realli scari bell word mean fluid tyler tell album came former member lambchop silver jew latterli celebr lyric acoust fingerpick panic attack interst tour musician afford phobia tyler turn disast opportun take road less travel enforc slowdown soundtrack countri music german motorik sine drive music both tradit alongsid knopfler find onto lush studi americana thrum love south place synonym tyler argu worst past kingdom jone roil bright fingerpick raga bear wit jone counti mississippi histor enclav vanish america truck stop town clich bleak long rif film photographi song tyler parent come small southern place return cabin univers town write spaciou song tradit transcend albion moonlight reverber twang behind guitar sound like someon work sheet metal next door great unwind album heroic closer take name yorker writer georg packer celebr account american inequ want punch unexpect electr guitar solo midway roughli second undilut birdsong highway anxieti meanwhil betray fear though tyler wrote sooth bittersweet melodi chord progress sens accept succour design make blood pressur drop just three minut wilco drummer glenn kotch rattl life tyler awesom band complet bassist darin gray rourk tweedi justin vernon associ phil cook keyboard slip gear auster acoust framework tyler previou album also excel imposs truth reced mirror
121,Syrian family’s journey from Isis jail to audience with the pope,"Sitting in the hushed and ornately gilded lounge of a Rome hotel, Carolyn Tamras perches on the edge of a   pink velvet sofa. For three days last year, says Carolyn, she sat “like this” leaning forward and wrapping her arms around her knees, head bent, gently rocking. “Then I thought, I am no use to my family like this. This is my challenge. ” It is her husband Martin’s 49th birthday and the couple can scarcely believe that he has just been wished many happy returns by Pope Francis in a private audience. They are still glowing from the experience, as any fellow Catholics would be. But there is a unique dimension to their joy: on this date last year Martin, their two sons, then teenagers, and their daughter, were being held in an Islamic State torture centre. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit and waiting to be killed, having seen his cousin and two other men put to death in front of him. Syrian Christians, Martin and Carolyn lived with their three children in Tal Tamr, a little town 25 miles from the city of Hasakah, in the   of the country. On 23 February 2015 Isis arrived, bombing and burning homes and churches. Surrounding houses, the militants   exits with explosives, trapping people inside while they took out any armed resistance. They then returned to usher 97 men, women and children out of their temporary prisons and into trucks. By chance, Martin and Carolyn were away shopping in Hasakah that day and the couple had decided to stay the night rather than drive back. As they prepared to go to bed, Martin got a phone call from his son, Tommy. “Daesh are here! They have surrounded us!” Martin persuaded his wife to let him drive back to the village alone. “I lied to her,” said Martin. “I didn’t tell her what he said, I knew she would not stay in safety if I told her the truth. ” He arrived in time to be herded along with the others, Christian, Muslim and Hindu. They were held in brutal, overcrowded conditions, forced to witness electrocutions and beheadings, given water polluted with diesel and food that was infested with insects.  Although the father and sons were held together, with the other men from the town, their daughter was held separately in a group of women who were constantly taunted that they were to become Isis “brides”. For 12 months, Carolyn and religious groups were bombarded with demands for $16m (£12m) in ransom. A video of three men being killed was sent to them as a threat. Martin was in the video, clearly marked out for future death. As a desperate effort began to raise money, Carolyn had to endure the taunting contact of an Isis negotiator through the messaging service WhatsApp. “At first I was disgusted, but then I realised he was human and through this humanity I might help my family. He began to trust me, to tell me about his sick baby. I looked up what medicines might help and sent him back details. ” The couple believe this human contact between Carolyn and Isis is what kept Martin alive. “Because Isis founded their actions based on religion, this is a challenge,” said Carolyn. “Isis may be Islamic, but it is unfair to judge Muslims by Isis. We have to judge on human values, meet on human values. I saw humanity in that man,” she said. The family’s release came as unexpectedly as their capture. Hearing a rumour that buses had been seen arriving in Tal Tamr, Carolyn and other relatives rushed to the desolated village. More than $5m had been raised and handed over, some via Catholic clergy in Syria, some via the Assyrian church  —   the family do not know the details and the issue of the ransom is difficult. “Slaves, bought and sold,” Martin said. “I could not believe this. Going back 1, 000 years to slavery. This is painful for me. ” As a middleman handed over sacks of banknotes to the Isis fighters, the 93 hostages stepped off the buses. Carolyn remembers: “I was running, running, like a crazy woman! I saw Tommy first, then my youngest, and I had my arms around them both, hugging, hugging. I couldn’t believe it was real. ” Martin grins: “She forgot me! So I had to tap her on the shoulder and say, ‘Excuse me, madam, do you not recognise your husband? ’” The children had witnessed terrible barbarity  —   their daughter talked of decapitations where heads “were lined up like tomatoes” on walls for children to play football with  —   but they are, her mother says, coping. The hostages all now suffer from kidney and lung complaints, after a year of water fed through pipes used for diesel, and days on end in packed cells in which no one had the space to lie down. One of Martin’s first tasks after release was to talk to the families of the three dead. “The doctor, his sister, still will not believe it,” he says sadly. Another captive  —   a girl picked out to be raped by a judge in Raqqa who had looked among the hostages for a “wife”  —   is still missing. “And, of course, we are still trying to help the father of this girl to find her. ” Their homes razed, the hostages cannot return to Tal Tamr. Of the 45 families affected, only two remain in Syria. “I understand why,” says Carolyn. “Yes, we lost everything, our home, everything we owned. But if we leave Syria you cannot stand up for peace. We lose our power. I hope we give Syrians courage. “It is my dream to rebuild our home in Tal Tamr. To say, ‘we are here, we live here’. This is my dream. ” Their story is one they now hope to use. By coming forward as peace campaigners, the family hope to begin working to bring unity to Syria’s traumatised faiths even as the civil war rages on. “It’s an important opportunity for us to be here because the business of our faith is peace, and so we have a duty to witness this fundamental conviction and to share the story and the message of mercy and love with others,” says Martin. “Much is written in books about theology this is not theology, this is life. We have been forced to confront the worst and our role is now to be witnesses. It is a real test to believe in mercy,” he says. “Of course at first I want to kill these Daesh. I want revenge on those who take my children and who kill my cousin and my friend in front of me, and who taunt me that I am next. Those who mock my wife and destroy my home, who want to buy and sell human beings. “Yes, I want justice, I want them to be brought to justice, but I will not hate them, and I will not hate my Muslim neighbour. It’s important to think, to go back to family, to faith and to education . .. only forgiveness breeds peace. Only peace makes us comfortable. We will work together,” he says. “In Syria, we are not unique. This is universal. People across the world are living in such difficulties, what is important is how we confront it. ” On Martin’s big day at the Vatican, he received a congratulatory phone call from the family. Hasakah is relatively peaceful at the moment. “For the last two weeks at least we feel safe,” says Tommy, on his father’s mobile phone screen, his grinning little brother beside him. Their parents light up at the sight of their boys. “This is my only regret,” says Carolyn, “that the family could not all be here together. ” If all five had been in Italy together, would that mean she wouldn’t have gone back to Syria? “Oh no,” she said. “I want our message to be to those who harmed us: ‘We will stay here in this land to fight them, to fight them in peace.’ We are luckier than the refugees because our family is alive and still together in Syria. My daughter was not harmed by these men. We are lucky. ” Yesterday Carolyn gave a speech in Rome on her belief in mercy, on forgiveness and on peace. Today, as the bells ring out across St Peter’s Square, they will be going home, to the war zone where they have chosen to remain. The quality of mercy has been exalted by writers from Shakespeare to Voltaire. Pope Francis has made “blessed are the merciful” one of his key teachings. According to Fadi Daou, the chair of the   Adyan Foundation, a peace organisation that made their trip to Rome possible, mercy has found its perfect role models in Martin and Carolyn Tamras.",sit hush ornat gild loung rome hotel carolyn tamra perch edg pink velvet sofa three day last year say carolyn like lean forward wrap arm around knee head bent gentli rock then thought famili like thi challeng husband martin birthday coupl scarc believ wish mani happi return pope franci privat audienc they still glow experi fellow cathol would uniqu dimens date last year martin son teenag daughter held islam state tortur centr wear orang jumpsuit wait kill seen cousin death front syrian christian martin carolyn live three children tamr littl town mile citi hasakah countri februari isi arriv bomb burn home church surround hous milit exit explos trap peopl insid took arm resist they return usher women children temporari prison truck chanc martin carolyn away shop hasakah coupl decid stay night rather drive back prepar martin phone call tommi daesh they surround martin persuad wife drive back villag alon lie said martin tell said knew would stay safeti told truth arriv time herd along other christian muslim hindu they held brutal overcrowd condit forc wit electrocut behead given water pollut diesel food infest insect although father son held togeth town daughter held separ group women constantli taunt becom isi bride month carolyn religi group bombard demand ransom video three kill sent threat martin video clearli mark futur death desper effort began rais money carolyn endur taunt contact isi negoti messag servic whatsapp first disgust realis human human might help famili began trust tell sick babi look medicin might help sent back detail coupl believ human contact carolyn isi kept martin aliv becaus isi found action base religion challeng said carolyn isi islam unfair judg muslim isi judg human valu meet human valu human said famili releas came unexpectedli captur hear rumour buse seen arriv tamr carolyn rel rush desol villag more rais hand cathol clergi syria assyrian church famili know detail issu ransom difficult slave bought sold martin said could believ go back year slaveri thi pain middleman hand sack banknot isi fighter hostag step buse carolyn rememb run run like crazi woman tommi first youngest arm around hug hug believ real martin grin forgot shoulder excus madam recognis husband children wit terribl barbar daughter talk decapit head line like tomato wall children play footbal mother say cope hostag suffer kidney lung complaint year water pipe use diesel day pack cell space martin first task releas talk famili three dead doctor sister still believ say sadli anoth captiv girl pick rape judg raqqa look among hostag wife still miss cours still tri help father girl find their home raze hostag cannot return tamr famili affect remain syria understand say carolyn lost everyth home everyth own leav syria cannot stand peac lose power hope give syrian courag dream rebuild home tamr live thi dream their stori hope come forward peac campaign famili hope begin work bring uniti syria traumatis faith even civil rage import opportun busi faith peac duti wit fundament convict share stori messag merci love other say martin much written book theolog theolog life forc confront worst role wit real test believ merci say cours first want kill daesh want reveng take children kill cousin friend front taunt next those mock wife destroy home want sell human be want justic want brought justic hate hate muslim neighbour import think back famili faith educ forgiv breed peac onli peac make comfort work togeth say syria uniqu thi univers peopl across world live difficulti import confront martin vatican receiv congratulatori phone call famili hasakah rel peac moment last week least feel safe say tommi father mobil phone screen grin littl brother besid their parent light sight boy thi regret say carolyn famili could togeth five itali togeth would mean gone back syria said want messag harm stay land fight fight peac luckier refuge famili aliv still togeth syria daughter harm lucki yesterday carolyn gave speech rome belief merci forgiv peac today bell ring across peter squar go home zone chosen remain qualiti merci exalt writer shakespear voltair pope franci made bless merci teach accord fadi daou chair adyan foundat peac organis made trip rome possibl merci found perfect role model martin carolyn tamra
122,Against all odds: why Phil Collins’ comeback could save pop music,"When news broke yesterday that Phil Collins was returning to live performance, some Guardian commenters reacted with utter horror. “As if we haven’t suffered enough this year,” wrote a miffed chrisf242. Lbonifacio also pulled no punches: “I thought it could not get worse. ”  Other commenters were more positive, but it’s clear that Collins’s return will be met in many musical quarters like the election of Donald Trump. You see, it’s hard to remember a time when Collins wasn’t a figure of   revulsion to a certain kind of music fan. That was truest in the 1980s and 90s, when he was selling a   100m records (one of only three artists to do so) and wearing some very bad jackets.  Back then, he was painfully unavoidable. Across the world, no chart was safe from his mushy AOR. No back seat of a taxi or supermarket aisle offered sanctuary from a sudden unexpected assault by Easy Lover or One More Night. For the multitudes of    —   who easily numbered as many the fans  —   Collins made “BMW music”.  When Bret Easton Ellis created the   stockbroker Patrick Bateman for American Psycho, his final horror de resistance was making the     sociopath an obsessive Phil fan: “Do you like Phil Collins? I’ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn’t understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins’ presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch is the group’s undisputed masterpiece. It’s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. ” Nevertheless, these also serve as reasons why Phil Collins’ return is unutterably, wonderfully, brilliant news. In fact, it might be the best thing to happen to music this year. It’s been aeons since we had such a convincing musical bete noire. Even before Collins retired in 2011, pop had become mostly crushingly mediocre. Everything is nice, perfectly produced and marketed. We are all cool. But there’s been nothing to rail against. Only last week, when I asked some music journalism students if they had any desire to “barbecue the dinosaurs” (as the gunslinging NME critics of the 70s and 80s were fond of saying of the likes of Collins and Rod Stewart) the room fell strangely silent. Perhaps that reflects the fact that the dinosaurs were never cooked at all, and in fact most of them are still touring, and being fawned over in the monthlies and by young and old alike. “I’d quite like to destroy Coldplay,” someone offered eventually, but while poor Chris Martin’s quartet have replaced Phil as   name for anyone seeking an instant example of what’s wrong with music, their output and critical reputation is like that of the Sex Pistols compared with Phil Collins a couple of decades ago. On a human level, it’s hard to begrudge the man, now 65, a final day in the sun after what sound like some seriously dark times: a third divorce, all manner of   injuries, which left him unable to drum at all, a public image nosedive following the tabloid depiction of him as a Tory tax exile who dumped his wife by fax (which he has since explained was all untrue) and a descent into alcoholism. At least he seems to have regained his sense of humour  —   and desire to get back at the critics  —   with the title of the forthcoming tour, Not Dead Yet. And then there’s the    matter of his contribution to British music. Yes, we may sneer at the mopey divorce ballads (although Kiss’s     frontman Paul Stanley, of all people, has been known to praise the ostensibly gooey Against All Odds for its “stunning, desperate vulnerability”) but we shouldn’t forget that Collins, as    powered Genesis through four decades, from cult prog rock band to   adult pop sophisticates. He played on Brian Eno’s brilliantly trailblazing albums in the 70s, and with the likes of Robert Wyatt. He pioneered the innovative gated drum sound that can still be heard throughout pop. American RB types consider him pop royalty. I even play Phil Collins drum fills in my   band (giving the killer drum motif from In the Air Tonight a new home in an intense, Joy   angular rock stomper). Granted, none of Phil’s influence on obscure Yorkshire trios, or indeed any of his contributions to the more avant garde end of pop, are likely to feature in his five nights at the Royal Albert Hall, but maybe some of that   solo material is due a reappraisal. One could argue  —   and I will  —   that If Leaving Me Is Easy’s moving electronic minimalism paved the way for James Blake, that Sussudio audibly reveals a Prince influence, and that few mainstream pop smashes are as inventive as In the Air Tonight. Collins will always divide opinion, but there’s every chance that his   hits  —   freed from the shackles of Magic FM ubiquity  —   will make next year’s gigs a final triumph. And if not? Perhaps somewhere, whether in Surbiton or Scunthorpe, some kid will be infuriated enough by the return of the Great Satan to reach for the nearest instruments and invent the angry, new future of rock’n’roll. At face value, we’re all winners here.

123,Clashtag: British Olympians ’steal’ #GBR from Nebraska Huskers football fans,"On the   plains of Nebraska, the abbreviation “GBR” means a specific thing to supporters of the University of Nebraska football team.  The Cornhuskers, so named in honor of the home state’s agricultural heritage, have won five collegiate national titles and 880 games since being founded in 1890, the   of any   university in the United States. They’re a big deal in the land of cows, corn and college football. And when a fan of the team roars “Goooo Biiiig Reeeed”  —   on the way into Memorial Stadium on a fall Saturday, at a pancake breakfast in a church basement, at the gas station or really anywhere in or around Lincoln, the state’s capital  —   she expects to hear a quick “Go Big Red” in response.  This is the cadence of a football season in Nebraska, and on Twitter, in Cornhusker circles (fans refer to themselves as Huskers) that traditional chant gets shortened to #GBR. Lately, however, Nebraska football fans using the hashtag have noticed something new popping up in their social media feeds as the Olympics get under way in Brazil. A Union Jack.  That’s because #GBR is accompanying tweets about the British Olympic team at the games in Rio. Using #GBR on Twitter now conjures up a “hashflag” a small, emoji graphic deployed for big events. The Uefa Champions League final in May had a small depiction of the European Champions Clubs’ cup, and February’s Super Bowl had a tiny Vince Lombardi trophy. Understandably, the hashflag has ruffled the feathers of Cornhusker fans. As sports blogger Husker Mike lamented on Tuesday: “. .. all of a sudden, the #GBR now has the British Union Jack attached to it. Wait . .. didn’t we win two wars against the British so that we were free of England, her Majesty and that flag?” It has also caused some consternation as fans mourn the loss of beloved    kicker Sam Foltz, who died in a car accident on 23 July. Kyle Hobbs, a Lincoln resident, was at a nearby casino when he learned of Foltz’s death and tweeted out his support, only to see a British flag accompany his words. “I tweeted so fast I thought maybe I accidentally hit a flag emoji. ” Perhaps no one in America monitors the GBR hashtag as closely as Kelly Mosier, the University of Nebraska athletic department’s director of digital communications. One of his duties is to manage an official university Twitter account with more than 278, 000 followers. Mosier first recalled Cornhusker fans first noticing a British flair accompanying their tweets during the EuroVision Song Contest 2015. He wasn’t surprised when the flag popped up again this month.  “There’s literally nothing we can do. It’s the Olympics. It’s not like we’re going to call Twitter and say, ‘Hey, you’ve got to stop doing that,’” Mosier said. “It’s a big world. There are lots of people talking about lots of things. ” That hasn’t stopped Nebraska fans from proposing some   ideas as to how to handle the great #GBR conundrum of 2016.  Lance Knapple, an investigator for the state of Nebraska, tweeted at the official Nebraska athletics Twitter account that a football match should be organized between the Cornhuskers and Great Britain with the winner taking ownership of #GBR. An American football match. “If they want to cobble together a football team and bring it over here, we can get this set up right now,” Knapple said. “We can take care of it. ” Joking aside, Knapple admitted that he’s an Anglophile at heart. “It’s a great country full of wonderful music and writing,” he said. “BBC TV is by far better than American television. ” Mosier, who has made a few trips to London in his lifetime, also expressed his love for all things British, particularly the tiny,    image he’ll have no choice but to see thousands of times in the coming weeks as he monitors Nebraska’s social media feed. “It’s Britain,” Mosier said. “It’s a   flag. ” Still, sporting allegiances die hard.  But that, too, was said mostly in fun. Two days earlier the Huskers account sent out some qualified support to its hashtag mate of the next few weeks.

124,Moonlight review – devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America,"It’s been a particularly horrifying year for minority groups in America. The increasingly documented inhumanity towards African American men by police and the brutal act of homophobia that took mostly Hispanic lives at a gay club in Orlando have awakened many to the bleak knowledge that progress is stalling and instead, regressive views on race and sexuality are still dangerously pervasive. Stories of LGBT people of colour have been largely ignored in film or at least relegated to the sidelines while instead, we’re offered up the whitewashed history of Roland Emmerich’s tone deaf Stonewall or   Oscarbait like The Danish Girl. But, in a festival season that’s too often populated by quite literally vanilla awards fare,   Barry Jenkins’ astonishing new film is both proudly black and refreshingly queer. It’s a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a   and rarely approached   conversation about the nature of gay masculinity. Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, the film follows the life of a man in three key stages. Initially, we meet    Chiron as he runs through the streets of Miami, chased by his peers. He attracts the attention of local drug dealer Jean (Mahershala Ali) who comes to his aid and with the help of his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae) he gets him to open up as they take care of him at their home. It becomes a refuge for him, away from his mother Paula (Naomie Harris, giving her best performance since 28 Days Later) a nurse with a crack addiction, who alternates between overbearing affection and cruel neglect. Chiron is withdrawn and lonely, a target for the boys at school who seem to recognise something within him that’s still a secret to Chiron himself. In one, unforgettably wrenching scene, he asks Jean and Teresa what a faggot is and how he knows if he might be one. By the time we see Chiron in the second chapter, he’s a teenager who’s learned to survive by hiding his sexuality from those around him, slowly developing a tough exterior. But his true identity still haunts him, he cries so much he worries he might “turn into drops” and he remains a bullied and physically abused outcast. In the final stretch, Chiron is a man with a fully developed guard against the world, a toxic masculinity that’s led him down dark and dangerous alleys to avoid facing who he really is. Despite the difficult subject matter at hand, Jenkins avoids drowning us in despair. There’s a remarkably unexpected focus on the beauty that surrounds Chiron with moments of soaring wonder so perfectly aligned that there’s something almost Malickian about his marriage of lush music and dreamy imagery. It’s an entirely unique vision and wrongfoots us from the start. Similarly, the script avoids cliche and refuses to paint these characters as the stereotypes they’re so often presented as. Chiron’s surrogate father of sorts, played with exceptional deftness by Ali, confounds our worst Hollywoodised expectations. Rather than training Chiron to run drugs for him or grooming him in a predatory manner, he’s giving swimming lessons and telling him that his sexuality is nothing to be ashamed of. It’s yet more levity that helps the film from becoming unrelentingly grim. But Jenkins doesn’t pull any punches in showing the crushing loneliness and horrific violence of being a gay man in a culture where homosexuality is seen as a weakness. We see the visible and invisible scars that develop from a lack of acceptance and by the time we finally meet adult Chiron, played with incredible nuance by   Trevante Rhodes, he’s trapped by his own desire, regulating his behaviour to remove anything that could be seen as “gay”. The third act sees him return home to reunite with a school friend (an exceptional performance from Andre Holland) with whom he had his one sexual encounter with during his teenage years. There’s a thrilling,   chemistry in these scenes as we see Chiron’s performed toughness fade in the face of a love he’s so sorely needed throughout his tortured life. It’s beautifully choreographed and easily the most believably intimate gay pairing since Andrew Haigh’s Weekend. Every single aching glance is a poignant reminder of what Chiron has endured to get here. Moonlight is a profoundly moving film about growing up as a gay man in disguise, a difficult and damaging journey that’s realised with staggering care and delicacy and one that will resonate with anyone who has had to do the same. We’re starved of these narratives and Jenkins’ electrifying drama showcases why they are so hugely important, providing an audience with a rarely seen portrait of what it really means to be a black gay man in America today. It’s a stunning achievement.",particularli horrifi year minor group america increasingli document inhuman toward african american polic brutal homophobia took mostli hispan live club orlando awaken mani bleak knowledg progress stall instead regress view race sexual still danger pervas stori lgbt peopl colour larg ignor film least releg sidelin instead offer whitewash histori roland emmerich tone deaf stonewal oscarbait like danish girl festiv season often popul quit liter vanilla award fare barri jenkin astonish film proudli black refreshingli queer thrill deepli necessari work open rare approach convers natur masculin base play moonlight black boy look blue tarel alvin mccraney film follow life three stage initi meet chiron run street miami chase peer attract attent local drug dealer jean mahershala come help girlfriend teresa janel mona get open take care home becom refug away mother paula naomi harri give best perform sinc day later nurs crack addict altern overbear affect cruel neglect chiron withdrawn lone target boy school seem recognis someth within still secret chiron unforgett wrench scene ask jean teresa faggot know might time chiron second chapter teenag learn surviv hide sexual around slowli develop tough exterior true ident still haunt cri much worri might turn drop remain bulli physic abus outcast final stretch chiron fulli develop guard world toxic masculin dark danger alley avoid face realli despit difficult subject matter hand jenkin avoid drown despair there remark unexpect focu beauti surround chiron moment soar wonder perfectli align someth almost malickian marriag lush music dreami imageri entir uniqu vision wrongfoot start similarli script avoid clich refus paint charact stereotyp often present chiron surrog father sort play except deft confound worst hollywoodis expect rather train chiron drug groom predatori manner give swim lesson tell sexual noth asham leviti help film becom unrelentingli grim jenkin pull punch show crush loneli horrif violenc cultur homosexu seen weak visibl invis scar develop lack accept time final meet adult chiron play incred nuanc trevant rhode trap desir regul behaviour remov anyth could seen third see return home reunit school friend except perform andr holland sexual encount teenag year there thrill chemistri scene chiron perform tough fade face love sore need throughout tortur life beauti choreograph easili believ intim pair sinc andrew haigh weekend everi singl ach glanc poignant remind chiron endur moonlight profoundli move film grow disguis difficult damag journey realis stagger care delicaci reson anyon starv narr jenkin electrifi drama showcas huge import provid audienc rare seen portrait realli mean black america today stun achiev
125,If at first you don’t succeed: how Hillary Clinton came back from the brink,"Radiant in white, Hillary Clinton greeted the cheering mob at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, most of whom had waited hours in the wilting June heat to see history made. Inside what used to be a giant greenhouse, fathers held up their daughters to catch a glimpse of the stage where, they fervently hoped, stood the first American woman to be elected president. There were plenty of   women who had worked as volunteers in Clinton’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign, enjoying sweet vindication. “I’ve waited my whole life for this,” one told me. “I wouldn’t have missed it for the world. ” In her second quest for the Democratic nomination, Clinton has been much bolder in emphasizing her gender. Her entrance was preceded by a short film featuring the suffragettes, who won the right to vote in 1919, on the very day Clinton’s mother, Dorothy Rodham, had been born. “It may be hard to see tonight,” Clinton began her speech, “but we’re all standing under a glass ceiling right now. ” The line echoed a sadder day in 2008, when a vanquished Clinton endorsed Barack Obama. In defeat, she told her supporters: “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it. ” She was warm and human, and many in the crowd were left musing, “If only she had been like that in the campaign. ” In the intervening eight years, Clinton replayed the mistakes of 2008: her many failings as a politician (the critique that she was too brittle and unemotional) the constant infighting between her staff the fact she misjudged the delegate math and the lack of a coherent strategy or message. One of her aides described the 2008 campaign to me as “totally dysfunctional” adding “it was often unclear who was actually in charge”. Perhaps the most dysfunctional moment came right before that   concession speech. Some of Clinton’s current advisers still talk about the melodrama that played out until almost dawn. It deserves a full recounting, because it explains much about what went wrong, and Clinton’s disciplined course correction for 2016. A battle royale over the concession speech dragged on for days, so long that one aide compared it to the cold   Strategic Arms Limitation talks. As in other fights, this one pitted her male strategists, including pollster Geoff Garin and Howard Wolfson, her bulldog of a communications director, against some of the women, including campaign manager Maggie Williams, brought in late to restore order and bring some humanity. Williams was a close friend of Clinton’s who had worked for her when she was first lady, and even earlier, when she was a young attorney at the Children’s Defense Fund. Bill Clinton, Hillary’s most trusted strategist, had his usual role as   . The main issues of contention were how heartily Clinton should endorse Obama, and how much of a focus there should be on her gender, something she had not emphasized in the campaign: her advisers were fearful that voters would see a female candidate as too soft, and question whether a woman could be entrusted with national security. A draft went back and forth between the two camps, leaving it uncertain whether the     line, contributed by staffer Jim Kennedy, would survive (the outcome supported by the women) or be killed (the outcome preferred by the men). But Clinton loved it and approved a draft that night. Enter her husband, who fancied himself as a good editor. He jumped in, made some changes and his draft went back to Clinton hours later. “What’s this?” an annoyed Hillary asked. Told that it came from her husband, she replied: “It’s my speech. ” It was important to Clinton that she directly address her female supporters, who had desperately wanted, for history’s sake, to see her nomination at the Democratic convention. So she and one of her speechwriters hammered out a final version. When she stood inside the marble, cavernous ballroom of the National Building Museum the next day, barely a mile east of the White House, she uttered the glass ceiling line and the crowd went wild. ••• I have watched Hillary Clinton in her various political roles since she became first lady of Arkansas in 1979. Back then, she was still Hillary Rodham and I was a freelance copywriter for a political consulting firm, one that created advertising for her husband’s first campaign for the governor’s office. When I became a political and legal reporter, I spoke to her every now and then on matters involving case law, and the status of women in the law. At the Wall Street Journal, I was an investigative reporter covering money and politics I was told by a senior White House staffer that Clinton took offense at an article I had written in 1992 about the “FOBs” the Friends of Bill, an impressive network of donors that the Clintons had built. Apparently, Bill liked the piece Hillary thought it made them look as if they were using their friends. When I left the Journal to do investigative work at the New York Times, I wrote articles that were critical of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation that triggered the unsuccessful drive to impeach Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Nonetheless, when I held the most senior editing jobs at the Times, I was told by two of Clinton’s press aides, and by reporters who covered her, that she thought I was biased against her. She blamed me for the Times’ tough coverage of the Clinton Foundation, scrutinising the murky conflicts of interest as international donors and old contacts backed pet projects, as well as other stories, including one about her marriage that said Bill and Hillary’s schedules rarely put them in the same location. This history reflects Clinton’s wariness of the press (bordering on loathing) and what some friends describe as a streak of paranoia. She did not agree to an interview for this article, and while some of her closest allies agreed to be quoted, none would go on the record saying anything even mildly critical. I found the same dynamic back in 1992: people close to her feared banishment from Hillaryland if they talked to the press. This account is based on interviews done over the past months, and on my own observations from watching Clinton on the campaign trail, from Arkansas to now. When I met Clinton in 1978, she did not seem like a politician, especially compared with her exuberant husband, who was always running late and couldn’t stand to leave a hand unshaken. He was the most likable candidate I had ever met. She was smart, on point, and didn’t like to have her time wasted. She was considerably less warm, though I have since spent time around the charming, funny Hillary. Almost everyone around her today admires Clinton’s resilience, and tells me she has improved her political skills, up to a point but they also share her own assessment  —   that she will never be a political natural like her husband. ••• Rather than wallow in the mistakes of 2008, Clinton went to school on everything Barack Obama had done right, meeting and grilling some of his top strategists, including Jim Messina, who went on to deliver a second Obama win, and a UK general election victory for David Cameron. In September 2014, she had a long meeting at her home with David Plouffe, Obama’s campaign strategist, who told her she had to have a   data analytics team, a key advantage for Obama in 2008. In her second presidential campaign, there has been little infighting and no hesitation to stress gender (“Deal me in!” was her memorable reaction to Donald Trump accusing her of “playing the woman card”). She has taken more direct control, including the tactical decision to give her dogged rival Bernie Sanders almost everything he wants in order to unify the party. She has ignored the lingering criticism that she is a boring egghead, and instead embraced her policy wonk tendencies. While Trump has confounded with his superficial and often contradictory statements, Clinton has been prosecuting the argument that testing times demand a leader with grip and knowledge. “Doing policy is smart,” Richard Billmire, a longtime Republican consultant who is no fan of Clinton’s, told me. “She’s projecting the    thing well. ” She leans hard on her adviser Jake Sullivan, a former Rhodes scholar who served as her director of policy when she was secretary of state, and then as   Joe Biden’s chief of policy. Sullivan has long been her “  guy” and was a favorite to be national security adviser in a Hillary Clinton White House this is now complicated by the fact he sent some of the emails at the heart of the investigation into her use of a private server. On the 2016 trail, it was Clinton’s call to attack Trump early and hard. Her cogent diatribe against the Republican candidate’s ignorance of foreign policy in San Diego, right before the California primary, was by far her best speech this year, reflecting her comfort with portraying her opponent as dangerous for America. This time, no one is asking whether Clinton is tough enough. She has grown surer of her own judgment, a certainty that is both her greatest strength and weakness. Once Clinton has made up her mind, it is extremely difficult to change it. Dissent isn’t welcome, one former White House official told me he doesn’t think she would be a good president, because she “can’t stand hearing people say she’s wrong”. It’s not that she’s   (one of her criticisms of Trump) or uncollaborative (she was known for working well with Republicans in the Senate, and with generals at the Pentagon) she just knows that she’s right. ••• Right after the concession speech in 2008, Clinton left the Great Hall to meet and thank her staff. She began sending out   notes from an office she set up in downtown Washington DC. There, she focused on putting a dent in her campaign’s $22m debt. According to HRC, a book about this period by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton and her aides kept a master list of every major Democrat who had supported her, and those who had endorsed Obama. Missouri senator Claire McCaskill, in the Obama column, was marked down as the worst traitor of all for a nasty quip about Bill (she said publicly that she wouldn’t trust him around her daughter). Then came the call from Obama, within days of his election, to ask Clinton to be his secretary of state. “She did not make the decision to say yes easily,” a   aide recalled. “It was a hard transition to go to work for the man that beat her. ” Clinton said no the first two times. “She wanted Obama to grovel a bit,” another former White House aide told me. The third time Obama offered her the job, she accepted. Her main concern was her freedom to hire, and she brought over many members of Hillaryland, including former White House lawyer Cheryl Mills and former chief of staff Melanne Verveer. She also kept in touch with her aides, instructing them not to brood over how it ended. “There’s too much work to do,” she’d tell them. For the most part, Clinton and Obama had a cordial but somewhat distant relationship. A loyalty nut herself, Clinton was determined not to undermine the president. On a few occasions, she got annoyed at White House staff, especially when they tried to block her pick, Capricia Marshall, for an important state department post. Obama overruled them and approved the appointment. Still, Clinton planned to stay for only one Obama term. No one I interviewed said Clinton spoke to them about whether she planned to run again. She keeps her political cards very close and confides in few people about her career or her personal life. “I am not the type of person who routinely pours out her deepest feelings, even to my closest friends,” she wrote in her first book, Living History. “My mother is the same way. We have a tendency to keep our own counsel. ” Once she joined the Obama cabinet, Clinton talked little of politics at all. “She has a great ability to compartmentalize,” said a friend. If she confided in anyone besides her husband and daughter, several friends told me, it was her mother, who lived with her in Washington DC while she was secretary of state. The two enjoyed watching television together, especially Dancing With The Stars. Her mother’s death at 92, in 2011, hit Clinton hard, because Dorothy was the one who always reminded her of the importance of resilience. In one of her speeches, Clinton said: “I can still hear her saying, ‘Life’s not about what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you  —   so get back out there. ’” As secretary of state, Clinton’s poll numbers shot up. Rebecca Traister, author of Big Girls Don’t Cry, a fascinating study of sexism in the 2008 campaign, observed: “It was easier to embrace this woman in a state of diminished power, once she had lost the big prize. Her favorability ratings were above Obama’s. Gallup found her the most admired woman in America. ” Clinton became the most travelled secretary in history  —   almost 1m miles  —   as she tried to restore America’s international reputation following the Bush years, but the pace was exhausting, and constantly being on planes hurt her health. At the end of 2012, a stomach bug left her dehydrated and Clinton fainted the resulting concussion left her with vision problems for weeks. Her health recovered, and towards the end of her tenure at Foggy Bottom, as the state department is known, Madam Secretary purposely projected a hipper, funnier image, opening a Twitter profile that at the time said: “Wife, mom, lawyer, women  kids advocate, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD  …    ” Clinton was enjoying the benefits of a more approachable image, although the events of those final months in post would cast a shadow all the way to election year. The deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, in which the US ambasssador to Libya and three other Americans died, triggered many subsequent investigations and hearings, and led directly to the revelations about Clinton’s use of a private email server. An investigation into the mishandling of classified information ended earlier this month without charges, but there was a stinging rebuke from the head of the FBI, who called Clinton and her staff “extremely careless”. It was only after she left office in early 2013 that she started thinking seriously about another run. “She began meeting with important Democrats,” said one of her current staffers, people such as Bill’s former chief of staff John Podesta and Jim Messina. There had been other, earlier indicators: on the night of Obama’s   in November 2012, an exploratory political action committee was established, called Ready For Hillary, made up of strategists and close friends. Somewhat surprisingly, Senator McCaskill of Missouri  —   deemed treacherous in 2008  —   became its lead spokeswoman and one of the first lawmakers to endorse Clinton. She had been allowed   to Hillaryland despite her disloyalty, a rare occurrence indeed. ••• “Beaches and speeches. ” That was Clinton’s stock answer to people who badgered her about her plans in 2013. She insisted she hadn’t made a decision, a claim that left her loyalists and the press corps skeptical. In December 2013, she and her husband flew to Oscar de la Renta’s palatial home in Punta Cana, a swank area of the Dominican Republic where the couple went every year. That was the beach part. She signed on with the Harry Walker Agency, a   speakers’ bureau in Washington DC. A few of her advisers thought it was a bad idea to become a “buckraker” but she justified it, pointing out that her predecessor Colin Powell earned   fees for the same thing. Why should she have to be the exception? Clinton often bristles over what she views as an unfair, sexist double standard that requires her to be cleaner than Caesar’s wife. It’s a resentment that also fuels her natural tendency zealously to protect a zone of privacy. Clinton’s bent towards secrecy has repeatedly gotten her into political trouble. First, the early scandals, such as an investment in the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas, only really remembered by the most implacable   obsessives. Then there was her refusal to reveal billings for her clients at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock when Bill was Arkansas governor. She would not reveal the names of lobbyists and others who met with her when she was crafting the Clinton healthcare plan, known as Hillarycare, when asked by journalists or Republicans in Congress. Most recently, she has refused Bernie Sanders’ demands to release the text of her   speeches to Wall Street banks. Money is another area where Clinton can be  . One lifelong friend told me that Hillary is haunted by her time in Arkansas, when she was the breadwinner (her husband’s salary as governor was only $35, 000). After he unexpectedly lost a bid for   in 1980, the couple had to leave the governor’s mansion for a small, drab place. Although I don’t buy it, this friend said fear over sudden “poverty” explained her lust for the speaking fees, for which she and her husband have earned an astonishing $139m over the last eight years. The home they bought in Chappaqua, New York, after leaving the White House cost $1. 7m, while Whitehaven in Washington DC cost nearly $3m. Her description of being “dead broke” after they left the White House made her look out of touch. Clinton’s pledge to relax more and tend to her health left advisers such as Cheryl Mills and Maggie Williams free to tell her that she should simply retire from politics, at the top of her game, and enjoy time with her new granddaughter, Charlotte, who was born in September 2014. “She wanted a grandchild more than anything,” one of her close advisers told me. On the road in 2016, now 68 years old, Clinton has Skype calls with daughter Chelsea and her grandchildren (Chelsea gave birth to a son in June). Because Bill and Hillary used to Skype with Charlotte before the campaign, the toddler’s eyes sometimes wander off during the calls, looking for her grandad. Whatever temptation there was for a slower pace, however, has clashed with Clinton’s belief, bordering on missionary zeal, that she has been called to public service. (An early New York Times magazine profile of her in 1993 when she was first lady was headlined “Saint Hillary” and captured her faith in “a politics of virtue”.) James Carville, who masterminded Bill’s 1992 presidential campaign and starred in a documentary about it, The War Room, told me he was certain she would run again. So were many others. The lack of a strong rival (or so Clinton thought, until Sanders came along) made another bid enticing. So no one was terribly surprised when, on 12 April 2015, Clinton announced, via video, that she was running. The next month, surrounded by her family, she held a rally on Roosevelt Island in New York. At the end of May, Sanders launched his own bid, but was soon overshadowed by fevered speculation over whether Senator Elizabeth Warren, another liberal firebrand, might jump in.  Clinton focused on hiring her campaign staff. As well as the Obama campaign, she had spent a great deal of time studying another, her friend Terry McAuliffe’s successful bid in 2013 to be governor of Virginia  —   a win in a swing state where Republicans had held the governor’s mansion. Clinton hired many from McAuliffe’s team, selecting his campaign manager, Robby Mook, as her own. Mook, 36, is less showy than Bill Clinton’s Carville, or Obama’s Rahm Emanuel, but he is viewed as a talented tactician who understands data while still in his 20s, he helped orchestrate some primary wins for Clinton in 2008. Clinton hired Obama’s pollster Joel Benenson, and others who had worked against her in 2008. Gone were Clintonites such as Mark Penn, a controversial pollster whose private business interests became an issue in 2008. Mandy Grunwald, a talented   was one of the few longtime loyalists advising her. Very soon, she had a large paid staff that would balloon to more than 700 by the end of the primaries. (Trump, who claims to have mostly   his quest for the Republican nomination, has about 70.) When I visited Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters in May, I was surprised to see how much younger her campaign aides were compared with the previous team. A poster of her in profile, looking like Joan of Arc on the 2008 trail, seemed to be everywhere. The campaign occupies two floors of an office building near the courts, and the most important advisers are among the few to have private offices: chairman John Podesta, known for his grip of issues (Obama brought Bill Clinton’s former chief of staff back into the White House to drive through his second term climate change agenda in the face of a recalcitrant Congress) Jake Sullivan, and communications chief, Jennifer Palmieri (also plucked from Obama’s White House operation). The rest of Clinton’s staff sits mostly in the open until recently, everyone was crammed on to one floor. ••• In 2008, Clinton was criticized for acting like “the anointed one” on her campaign. Cold water was splashed on that notion very early in the race, when she came in a rather pitiful third in the earliest caucus state, Iowa, behind Obama and John Edwards. The biggest lesson she learned, she often said, was that she must “organize, organize, organize”. But 2016’s huge early Bernie Sanders rallies, filled with younger voters, tipped off her aides that she faced another tough climb in mostly white states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, and later in the midwestern Rust Belt. Stylistically, Clinton was rusty. In the snows of New Hampshire in February, there was poignancy to Clinton’s losing effort. I watched her campaign her heart out in Manchester, in Dover and in smaller towns. She was trying hard to forge an emotional connection with the voters she met. A lifelong Methodist, she confided that she tries to read a piece of Scripture at dawn each day, emailed to her by a minister friend. In one televised debate, she was asked a philosophical question about how she retains some semblance of humanity while at the centre of the political fray. She quoted a line from a parable that she called her “lifeline”: “Practice the discipline of gratitude. ” In the appearances I witnessed, Clinton drew smaller crowds than Sanders, her events often held in   gymnasiums. I noticed that she was raising her voice louder and louder, something others falsely reported as screaming. She seemed to get louder when she wanted to energize her audiences, to get them to applaud and shout her name. At the packed Sanders events, the adoration came naturally. The wobbly start hurt. Clinton was especially stung by the rejection from some younger women who didn’t seem that excited about the prospect of electing the first female president. She had devoted so much of her life to championing the welfare of women and children, and was now openly brandishing her feminism it was hard for her to understand why young women were so stirred by the    Sanders. The Clinton playbook was to do the opposite of 2008. But a member of her communications staff conceded to me that there remains one unfortunate similarity: a lack of narrative or clear message that sums up why she is running for president and where she will take the country. In 1992, her husband, advised by Carville and George Stephanopoulos, ran on: “It’s the economy, stupid. ” Barack Obama, advised by David Axelrod, ran on “hope and change”. While Mook and Podesta are extremely able, they are not political gurus, and Clinton has struggled to articulate her vision in a handful of words. “We don’t have an Axelrod,” the aide told me. It’s unclear if anyone might yet be found to fill that gap. Of course, Clinton’s main adviser, her husband, thinks he is that person. Another campaign official told me that the two speak on the phone at least once a day. But Bill has been less visible than in 2008, when he marred the campaign (and his own reputation) by calling Obama’s message a “fairytale” and drew criticism for suggesting “white Americans” were turning away from his campaign. More recently, Bill inflamed the email controversy when it was reported that he had met the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, in an Arizona airport just days before a decision was made on whether to prosecute Hillary. Lynch was forced to say she would follow the recommendation of the prosecutors and FBI officials working on the investigation. According to the 2007 book Her Way, by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, the Clintons have what they call “a   pact” from their Yale law school days. They both expected to be elected president, even if that dream took decades to achieve. Connie Bruck, who wrote an insightful profile of Hillary Clinton in the New Yorker in 1994, had a   White House interview with Bill, where he gushed over what a great president his wife would make. The idea was dismissed at the time. It doesn’t seem   now. ••• Clinton’s best political moment this year was in San Diego, right before the California primary. Flanked by more than a dozen American flags, she looked very much the   . Her speech clearly outlined her foreign policy goals: a strong, confident America engaged with the world, “to keep our country safe and our economy growing”. But the speech will be remembered for her scrupulously factual and devastating recitation of Trump’s most ignorant and outrageous statements about global issues. “They’re not even really ideas,” she said, “just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  —   because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” The speech took 10 days to craft, with Clinton involved. When she read aloud the litany of Trump’s statements, she turned to her speechwriters and asked in mock disbelief, “Can he really have said all these things?” At subsequent California campaign events, every time she mentioned the San Diego speech, the crowd spontaneously erupted in applause and cheers. This time, she did not need to raise her voice. In New Hampshire earlier this month, after a tetchy campaign season, Sanders and Clinton finally joined forces as he endorsed her  —   they even hugged  —   speaking from a lectern decorated with a “Stronger Together” logo. On the trail, Sanders had questioned her judgment and fitness for office, but in endorsing Clinton, he called her a first lady who had broken precedent, a leader in the fight for universal healthcare, “a fierce advocate for the rights of our children” and declared her “one of the most intelligent people that we have ever met”. Thumping the lectern, he proclaimed: “Hillary Clinton would make an outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her today. ” It wasn’t picked for this reason, but at Balboa Park, where Clinton spoke in San Diego, there is a large statue of a Mayan woman. That ancient culture records women among its most powerful leaders. Next week at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, it is finally Clinton’s turn, with two past presidents  —   her husband and Obama  —   appearing in service of her nomination as the party’s presidential candidate. She will tell Americans she is ready to lead and, in November, hopes finally to take a hammer to that last glass ceiling.",radiant white hillari clinton greet cheer brooklyn navi yard wait hour wilt

126,Jon Jones stripped of UFC title after one-year doping ban upheld,"Jon Jones has been stripped of the UFC interim light heavyweight championship after an arbitration panel denied his appeal of a positive test and upheld a doping ban that will run through July. Widely considered the world’s best    fighter, Jones was pulled from a July bout against Daniel Cormier at UFC 200 shortly after news about the positive drug test. Jones claimed to have taken a   pill but ended up testing positive for two banned   agents. “Jon Jones has blown it in every way shape and form a guy with that much talent can blow it,” UFC president Dana White told ESPN. “Greatest talent ever and the biggest   ever. ” The    won the newly created interim title in April when he defeated Ovince St Preux at UFC 197.  The US   Agency, which handles UFC testing, declared Jones ineligible. He took the case to arbitration and that panel delivered the maximum   suspension, saying Jones’ “degree of fault verged on the reckless”. Jones is eligible again on 7 July 2017. UFC issued a statement saying it was aware of the   ban, which began on 6 July. “While the decision indicates no evidence of Jones’ intentional use of banned substances, it does highlight the care and diligence that is required by athletes competing in the UFC to ensure that no prohibited substances enter their system,” the UFC statement says.",jone strip interim light heavyweight championship arbitr panel deni appeal posit test upheld dope juli wide consid world best fighter jone pull juli bout daniel cormier shortli news posit drug test jone claim taken pill end test posit ban agent jone blown everi shape form much talent blow presid dana white told espn greatest talent ever biggest ever newli creat interim titl april defeat ovinc preux agenc handl test declar jone inelig took case arbitr panel deliv maximum suspens say jone degre fault verg reckless jone elig juli issu statement say awar began juli while decis indic evid jone intent ban substanc highlight care dilig requir athlet compet ensur prohibit substanc enter system statement say
127,Dominican woman jailed as a man in Miami prison files $5m lawsuit,"A Dominican woman who says she was wrongly classified as a man and held with male inmates for 10 hours in a Miami prison has filed a US federal lawsuit alleging negligence and civil rights violations. The filing comes three years after Fiordaliza Pichardo was arrested at Miami’s international airport on what attorneys say was a   drug trafficking charge that was later dismissed. The $5m suit names the   corrections department as a defendant. Pichardo’s lawyers say she was initially booked as a female at the Metro West detention center but medical staff examined her and reclassified her as a man because they determined she had “  male characteristics”. Lawyers say Pichardo was then placed with 40 male inmates in an open cell where she was allegedly taunted and sexually harassed.   corrections spokeswoman Chandra Gavin said the department does not comment on pending litigation. Pichardo, who is married and has three children, was 50 years old at the time of the incident in November 2013. “She was humiliated,” attorney David Kubiliun told the Associated Press. “The officials acted with deliberate indifference by failing to protect her rights. ” Kubiliun said he did not know what the prison’s medical staff meant by “  male characteristics”. “We believe that those words were used as a   to their unlawful actions,” he said. “We are in the process of finding out what those motivations were. ” Pichardo is a former government official who was elected in 2010 as city council member in Bonao, a town north of the capital of Santo Domingo. Kubiliun said she traveled to Miami in 2013 for the birth of her third grandchild and had previously visited the United States without incident.",dominican woman say wrongli classifi held male inmat hour miami prison file feder lawsuit alleg neglig civil right violat file come three year fiordaliza pichardo arrest miami intern airport attorney drug traffick charg later dismiss suit name correct depart defend pichardo lawyer initi book femal metro west detent center medic staff examin reclassifi determin male characterist lawyer pichardo place male inmat open cell allegedli taunt sexual harass correct spokeswoman chandra gavin said depart comment pend litig pichardo marri three children year time incid novemb humili attorney david kubiliun told associ press offici act deliber indiffer fail protect right kubiliun said know prison medic staff meant male characterist believ word use unlaw action said process find motiv pichardo former govern offici elect citi council member bonao town north capit santo domingo kubiliun said travel miami birth third grandchild previous visit unit state without incid
128,Walmart ordered to pay truck drivers $54m in minimum wage suit,"Walmart intentionally failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage, a federal jury decided on Wednesday, awarding the drivers $54m in damages and opening up the retail giant to penalties. The seven jurors returned the verdict in a lawsuit accusing the company of not properly paying drivers in accordance with California law for activities that included inspecting and washing their trucks and for layovers. Civil penalties will be determined by a judge.  The company argued that the drivers were paid for activities that include those tasks and that they were not working during layovers. A lawyer for Walmart did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the verdict.  Attorneys for the more than 800 drivers who worked for Walmart between October 2005 and October 2015 were seeking $72m in damages, the bulk of it for layovers. They said during the trial that additional damages and penalties could push the total amount Walmart owed to more than $150m.    Walmart Stores Inc, the nation’s largest private employer, has faced other criticism over its pay and treatment of US employees.  The company announced last year that it was giving a raise to about a   US workers. The raises were part of a $1bn investment that the retailer said was also intended to give workers more opportunities to advance and more consistent schedules.  Walmart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities.  The drivers’ attorneys pointed to a ruling in their favor from US district judge Susan Illston, who said last year that Walmart would be in violation of California law if it enforced its driver pay manuals because they say no pay is earned for certain tasks.  “There’s nothing in any of those three manuals that covered 10 years of time that show the drivers were paid for any of these tasks that are on your verdict form,” attorney Butch Wagner said during closing arguments.  Drivers were also not paid minimum wage for layovers even though Walmart controlled their time by requiring them to stay with their trucks, the plaintiffs’ attorneys said.  The company argued that it paid drivers for activities that included other, smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes.  Walmart attorney Scott Edelman likened what the plaintiffs were asking for to a baker who charges a flat fee for a cake, not the individual tasks of buying the eggs, putting the cake in the oven or cleaning the dishes after.  “When you pay a baker $20 to bake a cake, what are you paying that baker to do?” Walmart attorney Scott Edelman said during his closing argument. “Is it just to put the cake in the oven for however long? Because that’s essentially what the plaintiffs are arguing. ”  Walmart pays drivers $42 for   overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Edelman said. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said.  The company has said its drivers are among the   in the industry, with some making more than $100, 000 a year.

129,So what if Malia Obama wants to dance and Melania Trump once posed nude?,"Stop the press. Hold the front page. An    girl likes to dance! If this doesn’t sound particularly newsworthy, it’s because it isn’t. Or, at least, it shouldn’t be. But when you are a young black woman and your father is the president of the United States, all the usual rules about privacy, respect and general common sense apparently disappear. So Malia Obama, who has shown extraordinary grace while growing up in the media spotlight, found herself plastered across the internet for the cardinal sin of dancing at a concert. Less than a month after her 18th birthday, as Malia hung out at a festival with friends, she gave the briefest of shimmies, which was immediately captured on video and translated into: “Malia Obama Caught on Video Twerking and Flashing the Crowd” and “President Obama’s daughter flashes her undies at a camera”. Taking the public shaming one step further, social media users were quick to complain that Malia’s trip to the Lollapalooza festival coincided with the Democratic national convention, a major event in the political calendar that, of course, as an unelected citizen, she had absolutely no responsibility to attend.  It wasn’t the first time that Obama’s daughters have experienced   public attacks. In 2014, Elizabeth Lauten, a spokesperson for a Republican congressman, resigned after comments she made on Facebook about Sasha and Malia Obama went viral. Criticising the girls for apparently not looking enthusiastic enough when they appeared alongside their father at a televised event, Lauten suggested they: “try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play. ” It was a casual occasion (the annual Thanksgiving turkey “pardon” ceremony) but Lauten castigated the Obama girls for wearing skirts she deemed too short, writing: “Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. ”  Perhaps the most insidious aspect of these attacks is that the real target is never the “shamed” woman or girl, but the political man to whom they are related. Lauten’s true intent was revealed when her post continued: “Then again, your mother and father don’t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter   …     So I’m guessing you’re coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department. ” Her mean and inappropriate public derision of two teenage girls was a veil for the real mark: their political parents. This week, Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald, was   in order to criticise her husband.   nude photographs of her were splashed across the front pages of the New York Post. Under the headline “Melania Trump’s    photos from racy shoot revealed” they reprinted a number of images from a 1995 photoshoot, which had featured in a   French magazine. To dig up ancient “racy” photographs of Trump’s wife adds absolutely nothing to the political conversation other than the heavy implication that such conduct is   of a first lady, and might therefore reflect poorly on Trump’s candidacy. Women whose fathers, brothers or husbands happen to have political careers are treated as mere appendages of their male relatives  —   to be judged, critiqued and shamed for the sole purpose of reflecting embarrassment back on to the male politician. Just consider the media treatment of Justine Miliband, who was torn down for not having a homely enough kitchen, or Samantha Cameron, who was eviscerated for wearing a sleeveless dress to a church service.  Malia and Sasha Obama have not only experienced this suffocating scrutiny throughout eight years of their childhood and teenage years, but have also endured horrifying racist abuse  —   from accusations that Malia only won her place at university because she is black, to commentators describing her with racial slurs online. The same kind of abuse has dogged Michelle Obama throughout two terms as first lady, most recently in a repugnant cartoon comparing her unfavourably to Melania Trump.  Of course, some public comment comes with the territory for adult women who choose to become involved in their husbands’ political careers. It was right that Melania Trump’s Republican convention speech was criticised for its plagiarism, for example, just as it is reasonable to discuss and critique any political speech made by Michelle Obama. But the criticism should focus on their politics and views. Neither racism,   nor moral policing have any place in the political arena. Nor should any such criticism focus on children who have made no attempt to step into the political spotlight. To tear down wives and daughters as if they are empty vessels of family honour is dangerous and demeaning. But it also distracts us from the real issues. Most political men offer ample opportunities for criticism, all by themselves.",stop press hold front page girl like danc sound particularli newsworthi least young black woman father presid unit state usual rule privaci respect gener common sens appar disappear malia obama shown extraordinari grace grow media spotlight found plaster across internet cardin danc concert less month birthday malia hung festiv friend gave briefest shimmi immedi captur video translat malia obama caught video twerk flash crowd presid obama daughter flash undi camera take public shame step social media user quick complain malia trip lollapalooza festiv coincid democrat nation convent major event polit calendar cours unelect citizen absolut respons attend first time obama daughter experienc public attack elizabeth lauten spokesperson republican congressman resign comment made facebook sasha malia obama went viral criticis girl appar look enthusiast enough appear alongsid father televis event lauten suggest show littl class least respect part play casual occas annual thanksgiv turkey pardon ceremoni lauten castig obama girl wear skirt deem short write dress like deserv respect spot perhap insidi aspect attack real target never shame woman girl polit relat lauten true intent reveal post continu then mother father respect posit much nation matter guess come littl short good role model depart mean inappropri public deris teenag girl veil real mark polit parent thi week melania trump wife republican presidenti nomine donald order criticis husband nude photograph splash across front page york post under headlin melania trump photo raci shoot reveal reprint number imag photoshoot featur french magazin ancient raci photograph trump wife add absolut noth polit convers heavi implic conduct first ladi might therefor reflect poorli trump candidaci women whose father brother husband happen polit career treat mere appendag male rel judg critiqu shame sole purpos reflect embarrass back male politician just consid media treatment justin miliband torn home enough kitchen samantha cameron eviscer wear sleeveless dress church servic malia sasha obama experienc suffoc scrutini throughout eight year childhood teenag year also endur horrifi racist abus accus malia place univers black comment describ racial slur onlin kind abus dog michel obama throughout term first ladi recent repugn cartoon compar unfavour melania trump cours public comment come territori adult women choos becom involv husband polit career right melania trump republican convent speech criticis plagiar exampl reason discuss critiqu polit speech made michel obama critic focu polit view neither racism moral polic place polit arena critic focu children made attempt step polit spotlight tear wive daughter empti vessel famili honour danger demean also distract real issu most polit offer ampl opportun critic
130,Chris Evans quits BBC Top Gear after just one series,"Chris Evans has quit Top Gear after just one series in charge of the BBC2 motoring show amid falling ratings, unrelenting newspaper criticism and a breakdown of his relationship with   Matt LeBlanc. The BBC is understood to be negotiating with former Friends star LeBlanc  —   thought to be keen to remain on the show  —   for a second series. Last month, it was reported LeBlanc threatened to quit if Evans did not go.  The BBC confirmed that it had “no plans to replace Chris” and that it did not expect to make any changes to the presenting  . However, it described rumours that LeBlanc had made an ultimatum as “categorically untrue”. In a surprise tweet announcing his departure, Evans said: “Gave it my best shot but sometimes that’s not enough. ” The audience for the Sunday night show has more than halved since Evans took over in May with Sunday’s night’s closing episode watched by just 1. 9m viewers, down from 4. 3m for the opening show. Before its relaunch, Evans told the Guardian he would be disappointed if the show had fewer than 5 million viewers. When it was presented by Jeremy Clarkson, the programme attracted 8m viewers at its height  —   notably in the wake of   Richard Hammond’s   highspeed crash  —   and always reached more than 2m.  BBC management was concerned about falling ratings for its most valuable show, which was worth an estimated £50m in worldwide sales before Clarkson left last year after assaulting a member of staff. The decision to leave was made by Evans, but one television executive said that Evans had “jumped before he was pushed”. With other broadcast commitments including hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show, Evans struggled with a barrage of newspaper stories alleging poor behaviour, most recently one alleging sexual harassment in the 1990s. The presenter could be questioned by officers from London’s Metropolitan police in the next few days. Evans has denied the claims and previously said the reports were a “ ” and that allegations of bullying were ridiculous. But Evans is understood to have buckled under the relentless onslaught of negative coverage. “Chris isn’t Jeremy Corbyn. He knows when it’s time to go,” said someone close to the show. “He now feels a real weight off his shoulders. ” LeBlanc, who, in contrast to Evans, has been widely praised for his onscreen performance, is understood to have told BBC bosses during negotiations over his contract that the partnership was not working. One source said LeBlanc disliked his  ’s behaviour on set, though the BBC would not confirm this. Reports that LeBlanc had vowed to leave the show unless Evans was sacked emerged eight days ago in the Sun, an almost constant critic of Evans over the past year. Describing Top Gear  —   which has been hit by a string of staff departures  —   as “ ” the newspaper reported that LeBlanc had “grown increasingly frustrated with his  ’s rudeness and frosty attitude towards the team”. Evans met Mark Linsey, the director of the BBC’s   production team, BBC Studios, last week to discuss the future. In a statement on Monday, Linsey pointed out that the show had been sold to 130 territories worldwide and said: “[Chris] firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production team and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want it to be. ” Evans is expected to receive just one third of his   fee to produce Top Gear, estimated at almost £6m for three years once all his other BBC commitments are included. He will not receive any payoff. Evans said: “I have never worked with a more committed and driven team than the team I have worked with over the last 12 months. I feel like my standing aside is the single best thing I can now do to help the cause. “I remain a huge fan of the show, always have been, always will be. I will continue to focus on my radio show and the allied events that it encompasses. ” Linseysaid: “Chris is stepping down from his duties on Top Gear. He says he gave it his best shot doing everything he could to make the show a success. “He firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production team and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want it to be. The new series has so far notched up over 30m views in the UK alone and has already been sold to 130 territories worldwide. ” The appointment of Evans was controversial from the start after he had repeatedly denied he had been approached to host the show following Clarkson’s departure after he assaulted a member of staff. The then BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw said Evans’s “knowledge of and passion for cars are   and combined with his sheer inventiveness and cheeky unpredictability, he is the perfect choice to take our   show into the future”. But Shillinglaw lost her job before the programme went on air, the first of a string of senior departures to hit the show. Most notably, executive producer and   Evans collaborator Lisa Clark left before Christmas, essentially leaving him in charge. The BBC made Clare Pizey responsible for the show in March, just two months before it aired to generally bad reviews. The Mail was scathing, described the revamp as “so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQ”   a reference to Clarkson’s new car show. Andrew Billen in the Times picked on the lack of rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: “Chemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie. ” As well as the lack of chemistry on and off screen, one source close to the show blamed a lack of preparation because of Evans’s “endless list of other commitments” such as Channel 4’s TFI Friday, the Radio 2 show and Children in Need. Evans hit back at tabloid claims of bullying that he was “out of control” as “nonsensical and facile and fictitious”. But the show also suffered a PR disaster when LeBlanc was filmed in a car with rally driver Ken Block doing “doughnuts” near the Cenotaph war memorial in London. Evans apologised “unreservedly” for the stunt and the scenes were never transmitted. The next series is already in   with filming set to start in September, without Evans.

Dick Pound, the former World   Agency president who authored a damning report into   doping in Russia last November, claimed the IOC’s decision had revealed there “was zero tolerance for doping, unless it’s Russia”. “The IOC had a huge opportunity to make a statement. It’s been squandered,” he said. The   Institute of National   Organisations called the news “a sad day for clean sport‚” adding: “The IOC has ignored the calls of clean athletes, a multitude of athlete organisations, and of leading National   Organisations, to do the right thing by excluding Russia. ” Meanwhile, Great Britain’s Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, said the IOC’s decision to pass the buck to its individual federations was “a spineless attempt to appear as the nice guy to both sides”. “I had a terrible feeling that this would be the case, that pressure would be bowed to, that arms would be twisted,” he told the Guardian. “The IOC were presented with an opportunity here to make a clear and concise statement of intent that the Olympic movement is to be believed in, to be supported, championed and enjoyed. “Unfortunately what we’ve been given is the absolute worst of all worlds. ” The British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers, who looks set to be awarded a bronze medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics after being beaten into fourth by a Russian whose sample from the event was recently found to be positive, was just as scathing. “The IOC is effectively saying it is OK to run a   doping programme,” she told the Guardian. “It goes against the value of the Olympic movement and everything that clean athletes believe in. ” The Canadian law professor Richard McLaren had also been damning in his report on doping in Russia last week. However, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted it was important to respect the rights of individual athletes. When Bach was asked whether he would be happy to compete against Russians, he said: “I would feel absolutely comfortable and fine because the protection of clean athletes is what I have always fought for. An athlete should not suffer and be sanctioned for a system in which he was not implicated and where he can show that he was not implicated. I am really convinced of this decision and fine with it. ” Under the IOC’s ruling each federation will be required to produce a list of Russian athletes they believe are clean   which will be checked by an arbitrator from the IOC and court of arbitration for sport. Any Russian with a doping conviction will be automatically barred. Many were quick to point out the inconsistency in that ruling, given that other countries are able to send previously banned athletes. In a statement the IOC said each sport would be required to “carry out an individual analysis of each Russian athlete’s   record, taking into account only reliable, adequate international tests, and the specificities of the athlete’s sport and its rules, in order to ensure a level playing field. ” With less than two weeks before the Olympics start vetting more than 300 Russians will not be an easy task. Sayers warned of another problem. “When it comes to making decisions about which Russians to let in, there’s going to be a huge lack of consistency between governing bodies,” she said. “I just believe the IOC have passed the buck and not shown decisive leadership. ” Within hours of the decision the International Tennis Federation had cleared all seven Russian tennis players to compete at the Games. “The seven Russian tennis players who have been nominated to compete in Rio have been subject to a rigorous   testing programme outside Russia,” it said in a statement. “The ITF believes that this is sufficient to meet the relevant requirement of the IOC Executive Board. ” Other sports hope to follow suit. Last week Marius Vizer, the president of the International Judo Federation, said: “The presence of Russian athletes is very important as the Russian Judo Federation is a prominent member of the International Judo Federation, with Russian judo playing a great role in the history of sport. ” Fencing is another sport likely to admitmost Russian competitors. But the International Weightlifting Federation may be forced to issue a ban on Russian weightlifters because of the country’s large numbers of positive tests in that sport. The IOC decision comes after months of agonising in the corridors of international sport about how to deal with the cascade of revelations of   doping in Russia. Last month the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, banned all Russian track and field athletes from international competition unless they could prove they had been comprehensively tested outside the Russian system. Only two athletes, Darya Klishina, who trains in Miami, and the whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova were given permission to go to the Games if they competed under a neutral flag. However, in another controversial decision, the IOC decided against allowing Stepanova  —   whose revelations of widespread   doping were a vital part of the Pound report  —   to compete in Rio because it claimed its rules do not recognise neutral athletes and because she had previously doped. The United States   Agency slammed the IOC’s decision, calling it “incomprehensible” and adding that it would “undoubtedly deter whistleblowers in the future from coming forward”. It said the IOC’s decision not to act decisively over Russia was a “significant blow” to the rights of clean athletes. “The IOC believes   should be wholly independent, and that is in part why it is so frustrating that in this incredibly important moment, they would pass the baton to sports federations who may lack the adequate expertise or collective will to appropriately address the situation within the short window prior to the Games. The conflict of interest is glaring. ” The prominent sports lawyer Gregory Ioannidis warned the IOC’s decision to pass the buck would stretch the resources of international federations and Cas in the coming days and would lead to procedural chaos and legal uncertainty. “Bach is acting like a Pontius Pilate figure in all of this, putting the responsibility elsewhere and letting them decide,” he said.",intern olymp committe face unpreced backlash group athlet decid impos blanket russian team compet next month game instead rule individu sport feder make summer olymp free decid fate russian basi dick pound former world agenc presid author damn report dope russia last novemb claim decis reveal zero toler dope unless russia huge opportun make statement squander said institut nation organis call news clean sport ad ignor call clean athlet multitud athlet organis lead nation organis right thing exclud russia meanwhil great britain olymp long jump champion greg rutherford said decis pass buck individu feder spineless attempt appear nice side terribl feel would case pressur would bow arm would twist told guardian present opportun make clear concis statement intent olymp movement believ support champion enjoy unfortun given absolut worst world british javelin thrower goldi sayer look award bronz medal beij olymp beaten fourth russian whose sampl event recent found posit scath effect say dope programm told guardian goe valu olymp movement everyth clean athlet believ canadian professor richard mclaren also damn report dope russia last week howev presid thoma bach insist import respect right individu athlet when bach ask whether would happi compet russian said would feel absolut comfort fine protect clean athlet alway fought athlet suffer sanction system implic show implic realli convinc decis fine under rule feder requir produc list russian athlet believ clean check arbitr court arbitr sport russian dope convict automat bar mani quick point inconsist rule given countri abl send previous ban athlet statement said sport would requir carri individu analysi russian athlet record take account reliabl adequ intern test specif athlet sport rule order ensur level play field with less week olymp start vet russian easi task sayer warn anoth problem when come make decis russian go huge lack consist govern bodi said believ pass buck shown decis leadership within hour decis intern tenni feder clear seven russian tenni player compet game seven russian tenni player nomin compet subject rigor test programm outsid russia said statement believ suffici meet relev requir execut board other sport hope follow suit last week mariu vizer presid intern judo feder said presenc russian athlet import russian judo feder promin member intern judo feder russian judo play great role histori sport fenc anoth sport like admitmost russian competitor intern weightlift feder forc issu russian weightlift countri larg number posit test sport decis come month agonis corridor intern sport deal cascad revel dope russia last month iaaf athlet govern bodi ban russian track field athlet intern competit unless could prove comprehens test outsid russian system onli athlet darya klishina train miami whistleblow yuliya stepanova given permiss game compet neutral flag howev anoth controversi decis decid allow stepanova whose revel widespread dope vital part pound report compet claim rule recognis neutral athlet previous dope unit state agenc slam decis call incomprehens ad would undoubtedli deter whistleblow futur come forward said decis decis russia signific blow right clean athlet believ wholli independ part frustrat incred import moment would pass baton sport feder lack adequ expertis collect appropri address situat within short window prior game conflict interest glare promin sport lawyer gregori ioannidi warn decis pass buck would stretch resourc intern feder come day would lead procedur chao legal uncertainti bach act like pontiu pilat figur put respons elsewher let decid said
132,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author sued by publisher,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author Seth   is being sued by his publisher for delivering a manuscript that Hachette claims is “an appropriation of a      work”.   who unleashed the zombie mashup on the world with the surprise 2009 hit Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and went on to write the bestseller Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is being taken to court by Hachette for breach of contract. The complaint, which was posted online by Publishers Marketplace, says that the author and publisher made a $4m (£3m) deal in 2010 for   to deliver two new works, with an initial instalment of $1m paid to the author.   delivered the first book, The Last American Vampire, a sequel to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter that was published in January 2015. But according to Hachette, the deadline for delivery of the second was extended from June 2013 to April 2016. The complaint says the   delivered the second manuscript in June 2016, but alleges that the work was “not original to Smith, but instead is in large part an appropriation of a      work” that it “materially varies from the 000 word limit” agreed on, and that it “is not comparable in style and quality to Smith’s wholly original bestseller Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter”. That novel imagined the 16th US president as the nemesis of the forces of the undead during the civil war. Hachette is suing   and his company Baby Gorilla for at least $500, 000  —   half of the advance it paid him six years ago, plus interest  —   saying that “by delivering a manuscript that varied so materially and substantially from that described in the agreement” he is in breach of contract.",pride prejudic zombi author seth su publish deliv manuscript hachett claim appropri work unleash zombi mashup world surpris pride prejudic zombi went write bestsel abraham lincoln vampir hunter taken court hachett breach contract complaint post onlin publish marketplac say author publish made deal deliv work initi instal paid author deliv first book last american vampir sequel abraham lincoln vampir hunter publish januari accord hachett deadlin deliveri second extend june april complaint say deliv second manuscript june alleg work origin smith instead larg part appropri work materi vari word limit agre compar style qualiti smith wholli origin bestsel abraham lincoln vampir hunter that novel imagin presid nemesi forc undead civil hachett su compani babi gorilla least half advanc paid year plu interest say deliv manuscript vari materi substanti describ agreement breach contract
133,Student debt made the domestic violence against me worse,"Amount of debt: $85, 000, Source of debt: College, Estimated time till debt free: Decades, Debt wasn’t something I could talk to my boyfriend about. In fact, there were many topics that were too dangerous to broach  —   that was just one of them. The red flags had been popping up all over the place. A healthy person doesn’t snap at someone for chewing too loudly or too fast. Getting your hand slapped for trying to show a funny YouTube clip isn’t normal. And being in debt shouldn’t result in bruises. But it did. The first time my   got violent, we were both graduate students living in Britain and had been together for less than a year. He violently shoved me and then acted like he didn’t mean it and that it couldn’t have hurt. Moments later he did it again. Nearly yanking my arm out of the socket, he threw me down the hallway.  I yelled at him that I would tell everyone, surely someone in the building had heard. He said it wasn’t a big deal and somehow convinced me that I had concocted the story in the midst of a panic attack. Being in this relationship was hard, and debt made it all the more difficult.  I had accrued over $85, 000 in debt over the course of six years. Around $5, 000 of that was credit card debt, and the rest was entirely education debt from undergraduate and graduate school. I had scholarships, but they barely scratched the surface of reducing the financial burden.  He was from Europe and didn’t have to pay a dime for his undergraduate degree. But I couldn’t talk about my debt because my boyfriend would berate me for going to college when I didn’t have the money to pay for it outright. He would yell and blame everything on me and my financial instability. That’s when I created filters to block emails from my student loans and credit cards, because my economic woes were too dangerous a topic to risk breaching. One of the worst fights broke out when I purchased tomatoes from a slightly more expensive store than the one he told me to go to. He stood in the doorway of the living room, repeating the same phrase over and over: “I pay your life! Why didn’t you learn the first or second time?”  I attempted to respond, but he barked at me to stop ranting and pulled me towards the kitchen. I tried to plant my feet and stand outside the door. I was crying out to leave me alone, to let me go, to just stop. Half of what I said was to him, begging him to stop, the other half was to myself, trying to wake myself from the nightmare, trying to convince myself that it wasn’t really happening. He grabbed my shoulders, to drag me closer. I struggled free. His hands left dark splotchy bruises up and down my arms. He shoved me violently against a closet door before disappearing into the kitchen. When he emerged, his demeanor was as if I was the one acting irrationally and he was there to calm me down. I landed a job at a prestigious university after working as a   childcare worker for several months. My new gig was also   but the pay was better and the future brighter. After my first day, I was brimming with excitement and had a reinvigorated sense of determination. It was a blistering cold evening so I decided to spend an additional $8 to take the train home. I was on the tail end of a nasty cold and didn’t want to make it worse with a long bumpy bus ride. When I got home, I let it slip that I took the train. He had given me $8 that morning to help me pay for my ride, and he gave me explicit instructions to not take the train home. He allowed me to take the train to work, because it was over an hour faster. The fury unleashed on me for misappropriating the money was horrific. “You bought expensive train tickets when you didn’t have to, then expected me to pay for your travel. ” “How stupid was I to help you?” “You repay my kindness by being selfish and you are blind to it. ” “Why do you have a degree? A lot of good that’s done you. ” “You are always miserable!” “Oh, great, you’re on another rant. ” “You’re just lazy and pathetic. ” Things were so bad that I downloaded an app to track my emotions. I encrypted journal entries and pictures of my bruises, locked behind a passcode. I stacked up evidence to fight my denial. The physical violence seemed to happen on a schedule, just enough bodily harm to keep me fearfully in check during the frequent emotional abuse. It took two years, but a day came when I had nothing left in me. I laid out the data and I could no longer convince myself that I was to blame for the flood. He was drowning me. I was fighting against a rip tide and couldn’t keep my head above water. I called my mom and asked for help. Without hesitation she said: “We will not let you sink. You are loved and you are coming home. ” Today, my debt continues to follow me. Talking about money problems can trigger terrifying flashbacks, but they lessen as time goes on. The fear of my debt feels like chump change compared to the fear I used to live in.",amount debt sourc debt colleg estim time till debt free decad debt someth could talk boyfriend fact mani topic danger broach flag pop place healthi person snap someon chew loudli fast get hand slap tri show funni youtub clip normal debt result bruis first time violent graduat student live britain togeth less year violent shove act like mean hurt moment later nearli yank socket threw hallway yell would tell everyon sure someon build heard said deal somehow convinc concoct stori midst panic attack be relationship hard debt made difficult accru debt cours year around credit card debt rest entir educ debt undergradu graduat school scholarship bare scratch surfac reduc financi burden europ dime undergradu degre talk debt boyfriend would berat go colleg money outright would yell blame everyth financi instabl that creat filter block email student loan credit card econom woe danger topic risk breach worst fight broke purchas tomato slightli expens store told stood doorway live room repeat phrase life learn first second time attempt respond bark stop rant pull toward kitchen tri plant feet stand outsid door cri leav alon stop half said beg stop half tri wake nightmar tri convinc realli happen grab shoulder drag closer struggl free hand left dark splotchi bruis arm shove violent closet door disappear kitchen when emerg demeanor act irrat calm land prestigi univers work childcar worker sever month also better futur brighter after first brim excit reinvigor sens determin blister cold even decid spend addit take train home tail nasti cold want make wors long bumpi ride when home slip took train given morn help ride gave explicit instruct take train home allow take train work hour faster furi unleash misappropri money horrif bought expens train ticket expect travel stupid help repay kind selfish blind degre good done alway miser great anoth rant lazi pathet thing download track emot encrypt journal entri pictur bruis lock behind passcod stack evid fight denial physic violenc seem happen schedul enough bodili harm keep fear check frequent emot abus took year came noth left laid data could longer convinc blame flood drown fight tide keep head water call ask help without hesit said sink love come home today debt continu follow talk money problem trigger terrifi flashback lessen time goe fear debt feel like chump chang compar fear use live
134,NAACP considers role alongside Black Lives Matter at annual convention,"In its   history, few National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) conventions have arrived at as charged a moment as this.  After   police killings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis and two targeted killings of police officers, the US is being forced to stare down its perennial struggles with race and justice. So as 5, 000 NAACP members, volunteers and leaders descend on Cincinnati, Ohio, one natural question that presents itself is: where does the venerable association sit in relation to the relatively nascent Black Lives Matter movement that has captured the nation’s attention with its loud, urgent protests against police violence? On paper, it does not seem much of a question at all. Founded in 1909 by the black sociologist, author and activist WEB DuBois, along with several liberal white activists, the NAACP has had a hand in all of the nation’s major race issues since then. It was instrumental in the fight against lynching in the first half of the 20th century, and the battles against Jim Crow segregation that defined the 1950s and 60s. “In the last century it had to do with lynching, ropes and sheets,” NAACP president Cornell Brooks told the Guardian. “This century we’re grappling with a form of racialized violence called police misconduct having everything to do with badges and uniforms. ” This comparison is one Black Lives Matter activists commonly cite, and the BLM rallying cry has even been incorporated into the NAACP’s convention theme for 2016: “Our Lives Matter, Our Votes Count. ” But this apparent congruence obscures fault lines which run through the relationship between BLM and the NAACP. In the minds of many activists, the NAACP is decidedly   both in its approach and its values. To many in the   driven BLM movement the NAACP’s institutional credibility is its weakness, suggesting it is too married to the existing political system. The respect the association commands in corporate and political circles is to many activists a fatal kowtow to the politics of “respectability” which stifles the dynamic range of blackness that exists. While the NAACP rarely directs critiques at younger activists, the points of divergence are clear. “We don’t hyperventilate in the streets,” Brooks said. “We have a clear, cogent message that we often lift up bodily with our presence in our streets, but we lift up that same message strategically and thoughtfully in state and federal legislatures. ” Brooks continued: “What we say to this woke generation is that you gotta be conscious and aware of not just the power of shutting things down, but also opening things up. ”  Citing voter suppression legislation introduced throughout the country, designed to make voting more difficult, he added: “And we say to millennials that your power is so important, that there is a well orchestrated plan to make sure you don’t vote. ”  Often, NAACP members and leaders frame their efforts as the real world actuation of BLM’s justifiable outrage. Carlton Mayers, policy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund’s Policing Reform Campaign, said activists making noise is critical to keep national attention on issues of racial injustice.  “You also need to have the people who are in the backdrop litigating these cases before the courts,” Mayers said. “They are the ones who are going to work to enact the policies that are needed to keep law enforcement accountable. ”  He pointed to the LDF’s sustained work in New York City, Baltimore, Charleston and Ferguson, all locations of   police killings, as examples. As Brooks put it: “We’re there before the cameras arrive and we’re there long after they leave. ” One of the major differences between the Black Lives Matter movement and the NAACP is generational. The NAACP skews much older. But with 30, 000 youth and college members on its rolls, its younger members have an increasingly strong voice. If they have a say, the melding of BLM and NAACP may come before long. “We keep the association honest and we keep them true to its mission and values,” said Stephen Green, national director of the NAACP Youth and College Division. Green is no stranger to BLM style direct action and believes wholeheartedly in its efficacy, but also in the NAACP’s   strategy. “We need to be engaged in the streets, we need to continue to resist. We need to continue to block bridges and disrupt highways,” Green said. “But also focus our agenda on the polls. Registering voters and disrupting the status quo is what i think our mission should be until [election day]. ” Green said that when he was in college, he became so frustrated with the NAACP that he nearly left with a mind to start a new organization. A former chairman convinced him otherwise.  “We have an association and it’s a democracy  —   just take over it, run it,” then chairman Julian Bond said to Green, an argument he found convincing.  “There is something to be said for those five letters that have been a framework and a groundwork,” he said. Unlike the diffuse Black Lives Matter, the NAACP has a rigid and traditional governing structure. The convention brings together thousands of voting delegates every year, much like a political party. They decide priorities and positions. “Black Lives Matter” also serves as a general slogan and rallying cry for people of all affiliations sympathetic to the cause of reducing racialized police violence, further complicating the question of leadership and structure. In the NAACP, the delegates and the leaders they elect, decide the mission and the tone. Green says there is a push from younger members to direct the association towards the ground BLM has staked. But he doesn’t see the two worlds as so far apart either. “There’s no difference between the BLM movement and the NAACP,” he said. “They may have a different vehicle but we’re all going in the same direction and I think that’s the key, that we’re all here fighting for democracy. ” The Cincinnati NAACP convention kicked off the same week that the Republican national convention began it’s coronation of Donald Trump across the state in Cleveland. Trump, whose campaign has been widely decried as racist, refused an invitation to speak to the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, just the third time a Republican nominee has spurned the group in the last nine presidential elections. Bob Dole in 1996 and George W Bush in 2004 also did not speak. The Democratic presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to address the convention on Monday. Her remarks were expected to touch on police violence, the Baton Rouge shooting that left thee officers dead on Sunday and voter registration.

135,Protest and prayer: Donald Trump visits black church in Detroit,"Donald Trump’s visit to a black church in Detroit met with disgust among protesters and activists on Saturday, but won praise from parishioners who attended the service at the Great Faith Ministries church on the city’s west side. A sea of protesters and a heavy police presence surrounded the church, as local residents along Grand River Avenue looked on. Chants of “No Trump, go home Trump” were raised by about 75 people in a march organized by local pastors and activists. The visit by the Republican presidential nominee came just two weeks after a speech to business tycoons in downtown Detroit was nearly derailed by activists who continually interrupted him.  Tony Minetee, who grew up near the church, called the scene on Saturday a “circus”. “Trump is an idiot, and he’s pandering,” said Minetee, 48. After months of harsh campaign rhetoric from the former reality TV star, Minetee said his effort to court the African American vote was almost incredible. “You can’t just talk to people like that and think it’s going to just smooth over,” he said. Rick McGowan, 62, carried a sign with a caricature of Trump that deemed him “unstable in all his ways”. “I disagree with Donald Trump on everything that he says,” he said. The Trump campaign would not allow the Guardian inside the church, as different aides said it was a “closed event” or said no press would be permitted at all. Events inside the church were, however, broadcast on television. As the service began, shortly after 11am, Trump shook hands with members of the congregation, then took a seat in the church’s front row, swaying back and forth to music.  To mild applause, Bishop Wayne T Jackson noted that the Republican nominee was in the crowd. “This is his first African American church he’s been in, y’all,” said Jackson, laughing and noting that the service would be a “little different” to those of the Presbyterian church to which Trump is accustomed. After Jackson spoke about the need for love and called on parishioners to hug and love each other, Trump could be seen hugging and greeting churchgoers himself. He posed for selfies and held up a baby. Trump had not been expected to address the congregation, having sat beforehand for a privately taped interview with Jackson that was due to be edited and published later on Saturday. In the event, he said he would read some remarks he had written several days earlier. Trump is not known for his strong Christianity: asked last year at an evangelical event in Iowa if he had ever sought God’s forgiveness, he said that he had not. Accordingly, he has struggled among white evangelical voters. In Detroit, his speech was heavily focused on faith and the importance of black churches through US history. Reading from a script and adopting a milder tone than that familiar from campaign rallies and debates, the billionaire businessman said: “We’re all brothers and sisters and we’re all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we’re in this all together. “I fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. I want to make them right. “It’s from the pews and pulpits [and] Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.  “There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers. ” Trump also noted that the Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who defeated the   Confederacy in the civil war and signed the emancipation proclamation. “Becoming the nominee of the party of Abe Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life,” said Trump. “It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the nation. ” Trump did not focus on crime and law and order, as he has done when speaking to white audiences, or touch on police violence against the black community, gun violence or mass incarceration  —   major African American issues that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, he focused on jobs. “I’m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can remedy economics so that the African American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and many different ways,” he said. Outside, protests continued. A group of clergy from across metropolitan Detroit denounced Trump’s visit. The Rev Lawrence Glass said Trump’s message to the black community and minorities  —   asking “what do you have to lose” through a vote for the Republican  —   was not genuine. “What do we have to lose?” Glass said. “How about voting rights, civil rights, human rights?”  The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, also criticised Trump’s decision to speak in his city and attacked the businessman on economic lines. At a press conference, in a restatement of remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Duggan said: “The difference between Donald Trump and Detroit is Detroit’s only gone through bankruptcy once. ”  The city is attempting to leave behind the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club last month, Trump sought to use the city as an illustration of Democratic party policies that he said produced “silenced victims”. Duggan noted key improvements, particularly falling rates of homicide and unemployment.  Detroit’s police chief, James Craig, told reporters at the church he had spoken to Trump for about 30 seconds, and said the Republican nominee told him: “Thanks for making us safe. ” As of 11. 45am no arrests had been made, Craig said. Activists claimed a woman’s shoulder was broken by a police officer during a brief confrontation prior to the service. When events inside the church were over, attendees said Trump had received a warm welcome. Frank Bailey, 69, had driven in from Farmington Hills, a suburb about 20 miles   of the city. He said he enjoyed the service, having been concerned about how Trump would be received, due to his low polling among African Americans. “I think at the beginning [of the service] it was slow, but the more he talks and the more he said and the more genuine he seemed to become, I guess, I felt that they really warmed up to him,” he said.  Jacquelyn Rhodes, a pastor at New Light Christian Ministries in Detroit, said Trump offered substantive remarks. A lifelong independent, Rhodes said the visit had bolstered her support for the Republican.  “He wasn’t my first choice during the primaries,” Rhodes said, “but I do support Donald Trump. I think he will have a plan for jobs. I think that’s what we need most of all in the city of Detroit. The economy needs to be improved, and the city has been run by mostly Democrats over the years, and I feel that the policies that have been enacted have not helped the residents in the city. ” Others were not swayed. Cynthia Price, a Detroit resident, said that as a Christian she was “supposed to receive everybody in love  —   whether we agree with them or not” adding: “I mean, nobody had any animosity toward him, because we’re all Christians. ”  Still, Trump’s comments had not moved her much. “For voting for him?” she said. “No. I’ve never been a Republican  —   that’s probably a poor excuse  —   but I haven’t decided who I’m voting for. ” Latonya White, another Detroit resident, said Trump’s cool demeanor before the congregation had “shocked” her. She had no plans to vote for him either.  “I was expecting to hear his view on what’s going on in the black community and I was open to hear what he had to say,” White told reporters. “And some of the things that he did say, as far as just coming out in the black community, kind of shocked me, I’m gonna be honest. “It didn’t change my mind, but it did give me an open mindset concerning Donald Trump. ” The organisation of the event was somewhat chaotic. The service was publicized as open to the public on a     basis, but upon arrival some parishioners found that tickets were needed. On Wednesday, the New York Times obtained a copy of scripted answers for Trump’s taped interview Bishop Jackson, prompting Jackson to say he would change his questions.  Duggan, a Democrat, said Trump’s decision to use scripted answers contrasted with his customary portrayal of himself as a maverick. The mayor highlighted one question Jackson intended to ask  —   “Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?”  —   and said: “Donald Trump can’t answer that question to a minister without going through scriptwriters and consultants. “This is the most phony major party candidate I’ve seen in my lifetime. ” After Trump’s address, Jackson presented him with a Jewish Heritage Study Bible, a prayer shawl and a pin. Wrapping Trump in the shawl, Jackson said it was from Israel and added that he had prayed and fasted over it. Thanking the presidential candidate for his speech, Jackson declared that he had another title for Trump: “Preacher. ”",donald trump visit black church detroit disgust among protest activist saturday

136,’Sanctions won’t stop our space race’: North Korea sets sights on the moon,"North Korean space officials say they are hard at work on a   plan to launch more advanced satellites into orbit by 2020. But they don’t intend to stop there: they’re also apparently aiming to plant a flag on the moon. A senior official at North Korea’s version of Nasa said that he hopes to see the DPRK’s flag in space “within 10 years”. “Even though the US and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space,” said Hyon   director of the scientific research department of North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration. According to experts, an unmanned North Korean moon mission isn’t that  . While the US is the only country to have conducted manned lunar missions, other countries have sent up unmanned spacecraft, and have in that sense “planted” their flags. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert on international satellites and satellite launches, said “it would be a significant increase in technology, not one that is beyond them. ”  Hyon said the current   plan, drawn up at the behest of the leader Kim   focuses on launching more Earth observation satellites and its first geostationary communications satellite which, technologically, would be a major step forward. He said universities are also expanding programmes to train rocket scientists. “All of this work will be the basis for the flight to the moon,” Hyon said, adding that he would like to see that happen “within 10 years”. North Korea has marked a number of successes in its space programme and its development of incresingly sophisticated   missiles for military use.  On Wednesday, it   what was believed to be a   ballistic missile into the seas off Japan, the fourth reported weapons launch in two weeks. It launched its latest satellite the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Brilliant Star 4 into orbit in February, just one month after conducting what it claims was its first successful hydrogen bomb test. The launches brought new international sanctions as nuclear tests and rocket launches, which can have military applications, are banned under United Nations resolutions. Hyon branded the sanctions as “ridiculous” adding: “Our country has started to accomplish our plan and we have started to gain a lot of successes. No matter what anyone thinks, our country will launch more satellites. ” He claimed that North Korea’s   target is to use its satellites to provide data for crop and forestry assessments and improved communications.  The US made its first lunar flyby in 1959, only six months after its first satellite, Explorer 1, though it took eight more years and several failed attempts to succeed with a lunar orbiter. The USSR made its first moon shot after only three successful Sputnik satellites. Its probe just a year and a half after Sputnik 1 reached the moon, but missed its orbit. “So it’s not ridiculous to attempt a moon mission early in your space programme,” McDowell said. “Given their low flight rate of one mission every few years, I think it is hard to see them succeeding in this in the next five years, but possible to see them attempting it,” he added. North Korea currently has two satellites in orbit,    and  . It put its first satellite in orbit in 2012, a feat few other countries have achieved. Its sworn enemy, South Korea, has yet to do so. Hyon said that as of 27 July    had completed 2, 513 orbits, and that within one day after its launch it transmitted 700 photographic images back to Earth. He said it is still working properly and sending data whenever it passes over North Korea, which is four times a day. Foreign experts have yet to confirm any communications from the satellite. “There’s been no independent evidence that   sent data back, but no evidence that it didn’t, either,” McDowell said. German analyst Markus Schiller, an expert on North Korea’s missiles and rockets, said a geostationary satellite might be a more ambitious goal for the country than a lunar flyby or  . “Hitting the moon hard would require less performance power, rocket size than getting into GEO [geostationary equatorial orbit] but it will still be quite a challenge,” he said. “Judging from what I have seen so far with their space programme, it will take North Korea about a decade or more to get to lunar orbit at best if they really pursue this mission,” he said. “My personal guess, however, is that they might try but they will fail, and we will not see a successful North Korea lunar orbiter for at least two decades, if ever. ” Hyon said claims that North Korea’s space plan is a military programme in disguise are hypocritical, considering the history of space exploration. The US Russia and China all built their space programs out of military technology. “It is the US that militarised space,” he said.",north korean space offici hard work plan launch advanc satellit orbit intend stop also appar aim plant flag moon senior offici north korea version nasa said hope dprk flag space within year even though alli block space develop aerospac scientist conquer space said hyon director scientif research depart north korea nation aerospac develop administr accord expert unman north korean moon mission while countri conduct man lunar mission countri sent unman spacecraft sens plant flag jonathan mcdowel astrophysicist expert intern satellit satellit launch said would signific increas technolog beyond hyon said current plan drawn behest leader focus launch earth observ satellit first geostationari commun satellit technolog would major step forward said univers also expand programm train rocket scientist work basi flight moon hyon said ad would like happen within year north korea mark number success space programm develop incresingli sophist missil militari wednesday believ ballist missil sea japan fourth report weapon launch week launch latest satellit kwangmyongsong brilliant star orbit februari month conduct claim first success hydrogen bomb test launch brought intern sanction nuclear test rocket launch militari applic ban unit nation resolut hyon brand sanction ridicul ad countri start accomplish plan start gain success matter anyon think countri launch satellit claim north korea target satellit provid data crop forestri assess improv commun made first lunar flybi month first satellit explor though took eight year sever fail attempt succeed lunar orbit ussr made first moon shot three success sputnik satellit probe year half sputnik reach moon miss orbit ridicul attempt moon mission earli space programm mcdowel said given flight rate mission everi year think hard succeed next five year possibl attempt ad north korea current satellit orbit first satellit orbit feat countri achiev sworn enemi south korea hyon said juli complet orbit within launch transmit photograph imag back earth said still work properli send data whenev pass north korea four time foreign expert confirm commun satellit there independ evid sent data back evid either mcdowel said german analyst marku schiller expert north korea missil rocket said geostationari satellit might ambiti goal countri lunar flybi hit moon hard would requir less perform power rocket size get geostationari equatori orbit still quit challeng said judg seen space programm take north korea decad lunar orbit best realli pursu mission said person guess howev might fail success north korea lunar orbit least decad ever hyon said claim north korea space plan militari programm disguis hypocrit consid histori space explor russia china built space program militari technolog militaris space said
137,Archaeologists identify oldest Muslim graves ever found in Europe,"Archaeologists working in southern France have identified three graves that are believed to represent the oldest Muslim burials ever found in Europe, dating to the eighth century. The skeletons at medieval site at Nîmes were found facing Mecca, and a genetic analysis showed their paternal lineage was North African, said the study in the journal Plos One. Furthermore, radiocarbon dating shows the bones likely date from the seventh to ninth centuries, suggesting they came from the Muslim conquests of Europe during that period. “Given all of these data, we propose that the skeletons from the Nîmes burials belonged to Berbers integrated into the Umayyad army during the Arab expansion in North Africa,” said the study. The findings add a new dimension to knowledge about the era, which had been limited to history books and rare bits of archeological data. “We knew that Muslims came to France in the eighth century but until now we did not have any material evidence of their passage,” Yves Gleize, an anthropologist with the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research and lead author of the study, told AFP. The graves were first discovered in 2006 near a major roadway in Nîmes as construction workers were digging an underground parking garage. A careful analysis in the years since has shown that the men were all laid on their sides, facing in the direction of Mecca, according to traditional Muslim burial rites. One was in his 20s when he died, another in his 30s and the third was older than 50. Their bones showed no sign of injury in combat. Another Muslim grave site has been found in Marseimulle, but it dates to the 13th century. One found in Montpellier may date to the 12th century.",archaeologist work southern franc identifi three grave believ repres oldest muslim burial ever found europ date eighth centuri skeleton mediev site found face mecca genet analysi show patern lineag north african said studi journal plo furthermor radiocarbon date show bone like date seventh ninth centuri suggest came muslim conquest europ period given data propos skeleton burial belong berber integr umayyad armi arab expans north africa said studi find dimens knowledg limit histori book rare bit archeolog data knew muslim came franc eighth centuri materi evid passag yve gleiz anthropologist french nation institut prevent archaeolog research lead author studi told grave first discov near major roadway construct worker dig underground park garag care analysi year sinc shown laid side face direct mecca accord tradit muslim burial rite die anoth third older their bone show sign injuri combat anoth muslim grave site found marseimul date centuri found montpelli date centuri
138,Britain allowed its populist right to rise. America should heed the warning,"Donald Trump landed in Scotland on Friday in a typically confused state of mind. Not because he was promoting his private business instead of, you know, running for president. But because  —   God bless him  —   he couldn’t figure out what just happened. It turns out that foreign affairs can be even more complicated than running a golf course. “Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote,” he tweeted. “They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!” If he had any aides or policy advisers, beyond his own brain watching cable news, someone might have told him that Scotland voted decisively to stay inside the European Union. And that Scotland will likely now vote to leave the United Kingdom and   the EU on its own. Such things might matter to an international businessman running a company in a foreign country. Or to a wannabe leader of the free world. But Trump told reporters on Friday that he wasn’t traveling with foreign policy aides because “there’s nothing to talk about”. That should calm the markets, if nothing else does. For the last few months, the snooty Brits have rather enjoyed the reality TV show known as the 2016 elections. It has been quite entertaining  —   although at times a little unsettling  —   to wonder if the American voter was truly reckless enough to nominate a strangely coiffed carnival barker with a casual disregard for the facts, running on a xenophobic and incoherent platform. Now the UK has voted to leave the European Union after a campaign led by their own strangely coiffed carnival barker with a similar hostility to the facts and to foreigners. But before Americans begin to chuckle at Boris Johnson and Britain’s   they should try to learn the lessons of what just happened in the old country. Otherwise they will be preparing for a Trump inaugural parade that rolls past a new Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in seven short months. First, the rise of charismatic,   leaders can only happen when the weak leaders of the   surrender to them. This is what happened to the British Tories as they struggled through two decades of a rising and rebellious   faction. We’ve been watching the Republican party do the same with the emerging Tea Partiers and Trumpers over the same period. In London, Conservative leaders tried to   extremists instead of pushing their   Euro rebels to join the UK Independence Party. David Cameron’s   promise to hold an EU referendum was a colossal miscalculation designed to appease his own extremists. That   tactic led his own country to economic crisis and ended his career. In Washington, congressional Republicans thought the Tea Party’s   and   spirit was fine to ignore as long they helped undermine President Obama. Instead of ejecting them to join a third party, they embraced them, including their conspiracy theories about the president’s birth and religion. Now, after alternately ignoring and ridiculing Trump, they are shocked that the leader of the birther conspiracy is their nominee. The GOP’s   appeasement has imperiled its own future. This weakness was summed up with more graphic eloquence by Sir Nicholas Soames, a senior Conservative MP and the grandson of Winston Churchill, who knew a thing or two about appeasement. “If you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,” he told the ConservativeHome website. “You can pat it on the head, in which case it’ll bite you. Or you can kick it really hard in the balls, in which case it’ll run away. ” Conservative leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have lacked the courage to kick anyone in the balls. Except, perhaps, themselves. The second lesson is about the siren call of nationalism. In an age of fractured media and financial crisis, it is refreshingly simple to attract a hard core of passionate voters with a nationalist message. Nationalism is a unifying force that exploits the resentment of economic and demographic upheaval. It is much easier to blame shadowy foreign powers and immigrants than it is to help older workers adapt to new skills in new industries. But the forces of nationalism, once unleashed, are not easily contained. David Cameron’s response to a Scottish independence vote was to stoke his own nationalism with a policy of “English votes for English laws”. Less than a year later, English nationalism destroyed his hold on power. The   nativism among the conservative base of the Republican party is no less mortal a threat to the GOP. After pandering to the   and   crowd for years, Republican leaders are now rightly fretting they will lose an entire generation of Latino voters. Like Cameron, they only have themselves to blame. The third lesson is a generational one. British voters under 34 were overwhelmingly supportive of staying inside the EU, but they were also the least likely to vote. That poor turnout meant the economic fate of millennials was decided by their parents and grandparents. Like his nationalist friends in England, Trump draws his electoral strength from older, whiter voters. To date, Hillary Clinton has underwhelmed younger voters who were drawn to the radical promises of her socialist rival, Bernie Sanders. Clinton cannot stop Trump without turning out younger voters in ways the Remain campaign failed to do in England and Wales. The fourth lesson is that voters don’t seem to care about the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the   politicians. Never mind that   politicians were railing against the elites and the EU. Never mind that Trump loves outsourcing and immigrant labor in his struggling businesses, while campaigning against, um, outsourcing businesses and immigrant labor. The sense of betrayal by and distrust of the elites is so rampant, it doesn’t matter who says it. “I think people in this country have had enough of experts,” said Michael Gove, the   justice secretary, who also compared   economists to Nazi scientists. The final lesson is that protest votes are not, in fact, a token gesture. They have a very real impact in the real world. For the next two years, as the UK negotiates its departure from the EU  —   and Scotland’s likely breakup from England  —   the protest voters will come to understand that the experts’ warnings of jobs leaving for Europe were real. Those warnings are also true across the Atlantic. If the US wants to end its status as the world’s only true superpower, it should close its borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China, build a giant wall to keep out Mexicans, and kick out 11 million residents. It won’t make America great, but it will be one hell of a protest.",donald trump land scotland friday typic confus state mind promot privat busi instead know run presid bless figur happen turn foreign affair even complic run golf cours just arriv scotland place go wild vote tweet they took countri back like take america back game aid polici advis beyond brain watch cabl news someon might told scotland vote decis stay insid european union scotland like vote leav unit kingdom such thing might matter intern businessman run compani foreign countri wannab leader free world trump told report friday travel foreign polici aid noth talk that calm market noth els last month snooti brit rather enjoy realiti show known elect quit entertain although time littl unsettl wonder american voter truli reckless enough nomin strang coif carniv barker casual disregard fact run xenophob incoher platform vote leav european union campaign strang coif carniv barker similar hostil fact foreign american begin chuckl bori johnson britain learn lesson happen countri otherwis prepar trump inaugur parad roll past trump hotel pennsylvania avenu seven short month first rise charismat leader happen weak leader surrend thi happen british tori struggl decad rise rebelli faction watch republican parti emerg partier trumper period london conserv leader tri extremist instead push euro rebel join independ parti david cameron promis hold referendum coloss miscalcul design appeas extremist that tactic countri econom crisi end career washington congression republican thought parti spirit fine ignor long help undermin presid obama instead eject join third parti embrac includ conspiraci theori presid birth religion altern ignor ridicul trump shock leader birther conspiraci nomine appeas imperil futur thi weak sum graphic eloqu nichola soam senior conserv grandson winston churchil knew thing appeas alsatian sit front growl bare teeth way deal told conservativehom websit head case bite kick realli hard ball case away conserv leader side atlant lack courag kick anyon ball except perhap second lesson siren call nation fractur media financi crisi refreshingli simpl attract hard core passion voter nationalist messag nation unifi forc exploit resent econom demograph upheav much easier blame shadowi foreign power immigr help older worker adapt skill industri forc nation unleash easili contain david cameron respons scottish independ vote stoke nation polici english vote english law less year later english nation destroy hold power nativ among conserv base republican parti less mortal threat after pander crowd year republican leader rightli fret lose entir gener latino voter like cameron blame third lesson gener british voter overwhelmingli support stay insid also least like vote that poor turnout meant econom fate millenni decid parent grandpar like nationalist friend england trump draw elector strength older whiter voter date hillari clinton underwhelm younger voter drawn radic promis socialist rival berni sander clinton cannot stop trump without turn younger voter way remain campaign fail england wale fourth lesson voter seem care hypocrisi inconsist politician never mind politician rail elit never mind trump love outsourc immigr labor struggl busi campaign outsourc busi immigr labor sens betray distrust elit rampant matter say think peopl countri enough expert said michael gove justic secretari also compar economist nazi scientist final lesson protest vote fact token gestur they real impact real world next year negoti departur scotland like breakup england protest voter come understand expert warn job leav europ real those warn also true across atlant want statu world true superpow close border billion muslim launch trade china build giant wall keep mexican kick million resid make america great hell protest
139,Canada military survey finds 960 victims of sexual assault in a year,"About 960 members of the Canadian military reported being victims of sexual assault in the past year, and 27% of women in the armed forces have been sexually assaulted during their career, according to the country’s national statistics agency.  The landmark survey, commissioned by the military, found 1. 7% of regular force members of the military had been sexually assaulted in the past 12 months, nearly double the 0. 9% rate of sexual assault among working Canadians. According to the Statistics Canada survey, which was released on Monday, 840 military members reported unwanted sexual touching, 150 reported sexual attack, and 110 sexual activity without consent in the 12 months before the survey was conducted.  The survey, which received more than 43, 000 responses and a 61% response rate among regular force members, found that women were four times more likely than men to report being sexually assaulted in the past year.  Women make up about 15% of Canada’s armed forces.  The chief of defence staff, Gen Jonathan Vance, said the results of the survey were both expected and sobering.  “Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution. We know it, and we are trying to tackle it head on,” Vance told a news conference.  “I’m more motivated than ever to eliminate this behaviour and the perpetrators from our ranks. ”  Vance launched Operation Honour, a military programme to address sexual offences, in 2015 after an external investigation said the Canadian armed forces had an underlying sexualised culture hostile to women and gays. Western militaries are increasingly coming under scrutiny for their handling of sexual offences. A Pentagon report in May said sexual assaults in the US military are still underreported.  The Canadian survey showed female victims were far more likely to be sexually assaulted by someone in authority, with 49% of women assaulted in the past 12 months identifying a supervisor or someone in a higher rank as the perpetrator. In contrast, 56% of male victims identified a peer as the perpetrator, the report showed.  Eight in 10 respondents reported seeing or hearing inappropriate sexual or discriminatory behaviour, including jokes, unwanted comments, sexually explicit material being shared or displayed, insults, or pressure for dates or relationships, the report found.

140,"Brexit vote puts Britain’s rising competitiveness at risk, says WEF","Britain’s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for Brexit, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its Global Competitiveness report had used data collected before the 23 June referendum. Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: “Although the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom’s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation”. The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions   including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development   which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a   impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade. The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels. The WEF’s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: “Today’s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business. ”  Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit. “The decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,” Fox said. “We are a proud and   trading nation. ” The WEF said the UK’s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered. Britain scored less well than the EU for its   environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world.  The three top countries in the league table  —   Switzerland, Singapore and the US  —   remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland. European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st. “For all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces” the WEF said. The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in   barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper   countries. Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder and executive chairman, said: “Declining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth. ”",britain sharp rise leagu tabl global competit highest place decad risk revers vote brexit accord world econom forum bodi run annual davo event said britain risen three place past year rank seventh said analysi global competit report use data collect june referendum note current competit economi world said although process condit brexit still unknown like neg impact unit kingdom competit good financi market well market size potenti innov studi chime report global institut includ intern monetari fund organis econom cooper develop said ahead referendum brexit would impact term weaker inward invest less trade studi challeng brexit support abl forg closer trade link countri outsid benefit reduct tape gener brussel report publish time govern mull exit strategi some minist favour soft brexit would prioritis access singl market other back hard brexit would make immigr control prioriti negoti chancellor philip hammond said today report demonstr abil sharpen edg improv competit thi govern build progress demonstr world britain continu highli competit open busi speak world trade organis geneva tuesday intern trade secretari liam said would push trade liberalis brexit decis british peopl leav symptomat look inward peopl want take control law money border said proud trade nation said competit reli highli effici good labour market rank respect countri assess third technolog readi score highli whole categori cover britain score less well environ larg larg budget deficit high debt ratio weak perform save despit rise place categori still rank world three countri leagu tabl switzerland singapor remain unchang rest made netherland germani sweden japan hong kong finland european countri made half said mark divid north south contin spain place itali drop spot greec drop five place franc second biggest countri eurozon rose posit economi europ maintain improv prosper level depend heavili abil har innov talent workforc said report also note increas develop develop world barrier trade burdensom custom procedur tighter rule affect foreign direct invest foreign ownership trend evid high upper countri klau schwab founder execut chairman said declin open global economi harm competit make harder leader drive sustain inclus growth
141,South Koreans flock to remote northern area to play Pokémon Go,"South Korean Pokémon Go players have been forced to leave their home towns and flock to a remote city close to the North Korean border in order to play because of the country’s mapping restrictions. As a   game augmented reality game, Pokémon Go relies on data from Google Maps to function, but South Korean security restrictions on mapping data have blocked Google from providing map features across a significant proportion of the country, including realtime information, 3D maps, personal transport directions and indoor maps. “Due to government restrictions on maps data, it’s impossible for Pokémon Go to work properly using Google Maps service in South Korea,” a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Local map providers use   maps that have sensitive areas excluded, but a law that prevents export of   mapping data stops Google from using it, despite having been seeking a license for the data since 2008. Google recently publicly challenged the law. However, a city close to the border with North Korea, called Sokcho, has not been classified as a South Korean territory and therefore has the mapping data required to make Pokémon Go function. One user posted on an internet message board: “I didn’t go to some big tourist attraction all I did was walk around for tens of kilometres to play a game. But I’m more satisfied with this than any other trip. I would still be in Sokcho had it not been for an urgent issue. ” Bus tickets from the capital, Seoul, to the city have sold out, according to reports.  Sokcho, which sits on the eastern coast adjacent to the Seoraksan National Park, has been quick to capitalise on its unusual status, sharing maps of free   areas and advertising itself on social media as “the only Pokémon Go holy land on the peninsula”. South Korea is the world’s   gaming market after China, the US and Japan, according to research firm Newzoo, potentially representing a big opportunity loss for Niantic and the Pokémon Company. The   game has yet to be officially launched outside of Australia, New Zealand and the US, with Niantic struggling to meet the server demands of existing players, but plays across the world have resorted to circumventing the region lock by sideloading the app on Android or downloading it with a US iTunes account on an iPhone. It has been downloaded between 10m and 50m times from the Google Play Store alone, while the app has been downloaded from a   Android app hosting service over 5m times.",south korean player forc leav home town flock remot citi close north korean border order play countri map restrict game augment realiti game reli data googl map function south korean secur restrict map data block googl provid featur across signific proport countri includ realtim inform map person transport direct indoor map govern restrict map data imposs work properli use googl map servic south korea person familiar matter told reuter local provid map sensit area exclud prevent export map data stop googl use despit seek licens data sinc googl recent publicli challeng howev citi close border north korea call sokcho classifi south korean territori therefor map data requir make function user post internet messag board tourist attract walk around ten kilometr play game satisfi trip would still sokcho urgent issu ticket capit seoul citi sold accord report sokcho sit eastern coast adjac seoraksan nation park quick capitalis unusu statu share map free area advertis social media holi land peninsula south korea world game market china japan accord research firm newzoo potenti repres opportun loss niantic compani game offici launch outsid australia zealand niantic struggl meet server demand exist player play across world resort circumv region lock sideload android download itun account iphon download time googl play store alon download android host servic time
142,Donald Trump is alienating his own party? That’s practically American tradition,"Is the Republican party trying to ditch Donald Trump? With each of his    outbursts, more Republicans fall off the Trump bandwagon. But this wouldn’t be the first time a major party has repudiated its top figurehead. In fact,   warfare is as old as America itself. When George Washington stepped down after two terms as America’s first president, the country elected   John Adams to succeed him. While Washington was nominally a founder and member of the Federalist party, it was the 1796 presidential campaign  —   waged between Adams and former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson  —   that gave rise to factional party politics. The Adams presidency also introduced America to its first taste of how political parties, designed to promote common cause, could also turn against themselves. When Adams stood for reelection in 1800, his only major ally in the Federalist party, Alexander Hamilton, repudiated him. Writing in a public pamphlet, Hamilton argued that Adams “does not possess the talents adapted to the administration of government, and that there are great and intrinsic defects in his character, which unfit him for the office of chief magistrate”. Without Hamilton’s endorsement, Adams came in a poor third to Jefferson and Aaron Burr. In 1840, war hero William Henry Harrison and running mate John Tyler were elected on the Whig ticket. A month later, Harrison was dead, and despite the fact the constitution did not clearly spell out the duties of a   in this situation, Tyler immediately assumed the presidency. In response, Harrison’s entire cabinet  —   with the exception of the secretary of state, Daniel Webster  —   resigned in protest, and the Whigs kicked Tyler out of the party. Sometimes referred to as “His Accidency” (during his presidency and to his face) Tyler essentially served as an independent, fighting both Democrats and Whigs on most issues, including two stonewalled supreme court nominations. Two decades later,   Andrew Johnson found himself in the same situation. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln selected Johnson  —   the only southern Democratic senator who’d remained loyal to the Union  —   as his running mate on a fusion “National Union” ticket designed to thwart challenger George McClellan. When Johnson became president after Lincoln’s assassination, he faced hostility on every front: southern Democrats viewed him as a traitor northern Democrats didn’t trust him Republicans opposed his lenient Reconstruction policies. This   loathing for Johnson ultimately led to the first presidential impeachment, though the Senate found him not guilty. Perhaps to erase the memory of their marriage of convenience to Johnson, the Republicans ran war hero Ulysses S Grant in 1868. He was such a beloved figure  —   what could go wrong? By the end of Grant’s first term, the Republican party was coming apart at the seams. Grant’s administration was so   that party stalwarts put up newspaper editor Horace Greeley  —   one of the party’s founders  —   as an alternative on the Liberal Republican ticket. The Democrats, also in disarray, pinned their hopes to Greeley too, though he ended up losing badly to Grant, whose popularity far outweighed any scandal in voters’ minds. It’s tempting to see parallels between Grant and Donald Trump: candidates with no political experience with campaigns bolstered by their name recognition. In the same way Trump supporters believe that his expertise in real estate will somehow translate to the Oval Office, so too did Grant’s admirers figure that what the White House needed was the brilliance of a military tactician. Grant failed, just as Trump will surely fail, too, if he’s elected.  In more recent history, the Republican candidate most closely associated with party disunity is Barry Goldwater, who ran in 1964 on a platform that aimed to cut social programs, roll back advances in civil rights and even nuke Vietnam if necessary. Despite attempts by both the liberal and moderate wings of the party to mount opposition campaigns, Goldwater won the 1964 Republican nomination, telling his supporters in his acceptance speech: “I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!” Democrats seized on the word “extremism”  —   and the views behind it  —   and Lyndon B Johnson was elected with the widest margin in US history.  Is 2016 shaping up to be another 1964? Will Trump’s extremism drive more and more Republican boosters away from him  —   and toward pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton?  Though some have already written obituaries for the Republican party, I wouldn’t be so quick to call the undertaker. With the exception of John Adams  —   whose Federalist party never truly came together before he and Hamilton killed it  —   every other case of political repudiation has ended up strengthening the party, not weakening it. If more Republicans abandon Trump, and he goes down in flames in November, expect to see a leaner, stronger, smarter Republican party rise from the ashes.",republican parti tri ditch donald trump with outburst republican fall trump bandwagon first time major parti repudi figurehead fact warfar america when georg washington step term america first presid countri elect john adam succeed while washington nomin founder member federalist parti presidenti campaign wage adam former secretari state thoma jefferson gave rise faction parti polit adam presid also introduc america first tast polit parti design promot common caus could also turn when adam stood reelect major alli federalist parti alexand hamilton repudi write public pamphlet hamilton argu adam possess talent adapt administr govern great intrins defect charact unfit offic chief magistr without hamilton endors adam came poor third jefferson aaron burr hero william henri harrison run mate john tyler elect whig ticket month later harrison dead despit fact constitut clearli spell duti situat tyler immedi assum presid respons harrison entir cabinet except secretari state daniel webster resign protest whig kick tyler parti sometim refer accid presid face tyler essenti serv independ fight democrat whig issu includ stonewal suprem court nomin decad later andrew johnson found situat abraham lincoln select johnson southern democrat senat remain loyal union run mate fusion nation union ticket design thwart challeng georg mcclellan when johnson becam presid lincoln assassin face hostil everi front southern democrat view traitor northern democrat trust republican oppos lenient reconstruct polici thi loath johnson ultim first presidenti impeach though senat found guilti perhap eras memori marriag conveni johnson republican hero ulyss grant belov figur could wrong grant first term republican parti come apart seam grant administr parti stalwart newspap editor horac greeley parti founder altern liber republican ticket democrat also disarray pin hope greeley though end lose badli grant whose popular outweigh scandal voter mind tempt parallel grant donald trump candid polit experi campaign bolster name recognit trump support believ expertis real estat somehow translat oval offic grant admir figur white hous need brillianc militari tactician grant fail trump sure fail elect recent histori republican candid close associ parti disun barri goldwat platform aim social program roll back advanc civil right even nuke vietnam necessari despit attempt liber moder wing parti mount opposit campaign goldwat republican nomin tell support accept speech would remind extrem defens liberti vice remind also moder pursuit justic virtu democrat seiz word extrem view behind lyndon johnson elect widest margin histori shape anoth will trump extrem drive republican booster away toward pull lever hillari clinton though alreadi written obituari republican parti quick call undertak with except john adam whose federalist parti never truli came togeth hamilton kill everi case polit repudi end strengthen parti weaken republican abandon trump goe flame novemb expect leaner stronger smarter republican parti rise ash
143,Little Men review – Ira Sachs’ achingly humane family drama soars,"Ira Sachs’ dramas are so understated in their ambition, they’re easy to take for granted. Love is Strange, his 2014 film about a married gay couple’s lives capsizing after they’re forced to move out of their New York apartment, argued for marriage equality with   stealth and power. His latest film, Little Men, uses a story about two young boys whose friendship is threatened by their warring parents to offer a piercing examination of gentrification in America. Sachs’ approach is so humane, and his characters so fully rendered, that an agenda never announces itself instead, Sachs’ worldview seeps into you. He’s that skilled a  .  Theo Taplitz is a remarkable discovery as    Jake, an artistic loner who strikes up an unlikely friendship with Tony (Michael Barbieri, equally impressive) after Jake’s grandfather dies. The death results in Jake’s father, Brian (Greg Kinnear) inheriting the building in which Tony’s mother, Leonor (Paulina Garcia) operates a quaint clothing store. Unbeknownst to the two boys, Brian and his wife, Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) have intentions to raise the rent significantly for Leonor as Brian’s sister (Talia Balsam) firmly relays to her brother, the property is worth $4, 000 more per month than Leonor pays. The resulting tensions this stirs up gradually come to affect the children’s lives. The bond struck by Jake and Tony forms the heart of the picture  —   and to watch that connection come under fire from circumstances that are out of their control is deeply moving. The parents, unsurprisingly, lash out horribly at one another when an agreement fails to be made, with Leonor at one point suggesting to Brian that his late father favored her over his own son. But no matter how heated matters get, Sachs and his terrific cast keep the proceedings grounded via a naturalistic approach that is endlessly absorbing and empathetic. No character’s predicament is entirely unsympathetic. The humanity Sachs and his actors depict is profound and leaves a mark. Dickon Hinchliffe’s perfectly judged score percolates throughout.

144,Police officer suspended for Confederate flag display near anti-Trump protest,"A northern Michigan police officer has been suspended with pay after he was seen   driving a pickup truck bearing a Confederate flag around a group protesting against the election of Donald Trump as president. There have been numerous reports of threats, intimidation and racially charged violence around the country since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. Officer Michael Peters’ suspension was announced on Sunday by Traverse City police chief Jeff O’Brien, who earlier said an internal investigation would start on Monday to see whether Peters broke any departmental rules. “He is not working as a police officer,” O’Brien told the Traverse City  . “I do not condone his actions. ” O’Brien confirmed that Peters was in a photo taken at Friday’s rally. The newspaper could not reach Peters for comment, and the Associated Press was unable to find a telephone number for Peters. The Confederate battle flag is seen by many people as a symbol of hatred and intimidation of African Americans following the civil war and the end of slavery. Its official use in southern states came under pressure in 2015, after a shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina in which nine African American members of a bible study group were killed by a gunman who was later found to have posed for photographs with the flag. The flag was flown from the rear bed of a pickup near a “Love Trumps Hate” rally in the city. The truck was then parked near the rally where the driver was seen drinking a beer. O’Brien said the behavior was intimidating and not a reflection of the police department’s mission, according to the newspaper. “We will get through this,” O’Brien said. “The community will get through this. ” Protests over the election of Trump have continued across the US, with violent confrontations with police in some cities. In New York on Saturday, more than 10, 000 protesters marched to Trump Tower. In Portland, Oregon, on Saturday night, 17 demonstrators were arrested. On Sunday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway reacted angrily to a statement by the retiring Nevada senator Harry Reid which accused Trump of fuelling his “campaign with bigotry and hate”. Conway said Reid should be “very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense”. In response, a Reid spokesman said: “Trump owes the nation leadership, not petty attempts to silence his critics. ”",northern michigan polic offic suspend seen drive pickup truck bear confeder flag around group protest elect donald trump presid there numer report threat intimid racial charg violenc around countri sinc trump defeat democrat hillari clinton tuesday offic michael peter suspens announc sunday travers citi polic chief jeff brien earlier said intern investig would start monday whether peter broke department rule work polic offic brien told travers citi condon action brien confirm peter photo taken friday ralli newspap could reach peter comment associ press unabl find telephon number peter confeder battl flag seen mani peopl symbol hatr intimid african american follow civil slaveri offici southern state came pressur shoot church charleston south carolina nine african american member bibl studi group kill gunman later found pose photograph flag flag flown rear pickup near love trump hate ralli citi truck park near ralli driver seen drink beer brien said behavior intimid reflect polic depart mission accord newspap brien said commun protest elect trump continu across violent confront polic citi york saturday protest march trump tower portland oregon saturday night demonstr arrest sunday trump advis kellyann conway react angrili statement retir nevada senat harri reid accus trump fuell campaign bigotri hate conway said reid care character somebodi legal sens respons reid spokesman said trump owe nation leadership petti attempt silenc critic
145,Time’s person of the year shouldn’t be Donald Trump – it’s clearly Vladimir Putin,"Donald Trump should not have been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. That’s not to make the schoolboy error of presuming the award to be a badge of moral approval: I know it merely recognises the individual who has dominated the previous 12 months, for good or ill. (It’s why Time has no reason to regret handing the 1938 accolade to Adolf Hitler.) Even so, and even though Trump was clearly the biggest news story of 2016, he still should not have won. For there is another figure who looms larger over this annus horribilis, albeit from the shadows. He ends this year with a wolfish grin, content that almost all his dreams have come true. That man is Vladimir Putin. He surveys the global landscape and sees almost every sign pointing his way. From Aleppo to the White House, from   to Brexit, this is the year the world was reshaped in his image. He may not have been the guiding hand behind every shift, though he certainly gave several of them a nudge, but together they made him 2016’s biggest winner. Start with Syria, which even in this year of horrors surely merits a special infamy of its own. The leaders of western nations ritually condemn the catastrophe that has been visited upon the people of Aleppo, eloquently denouncing the bombing of hospitals, including makeshift clinics hidden in basements, the flattening of civilian areas, the killing of children, the denial of food and medicine. And yet Putin knows he need not listen. Because the important fact is the one on the ground: no one has stopped him or his Syrian vassal, Bashar   from continuing the slaughter. Plenty have warned that Aleppo will be the Guernica of our generation, remembered among the greatest crimes against humanity. Future historians will ask all the same shaming questions. Why was there not more outrage? Did people not know  —   or just not care? Why did they not act? But there is another comparison. For Aleppo has received the treatment Putin once meted out to Grozny, when Chechnya dared rebel against Moscow. In 1999 it too was bombed into what the UN called a “devastated wasteland” an act of destruction tolerated because it was deemed to be taking place on Russia’s turf. But the de facto permission granted to Putin’s smashing of Syria counts as an even greater victory for the Russian dictator. Not only has he advanced his narrow, strategic interests, maintaining a presence in the Middle East and, in Tartus, a   port with access to the Mediterranean. He has won a less tangible but more valuable prize. He has proved that it is possible to kill or dispossess millions of civilians with impunity. Of course, some will say George W Bush proved that with his invasion of Iraq in 2003. But until now, Moscow might have felt constrained by the precedent of Slobodan Milošević, fearing that there were limits to how much blood you could shed before, eventually, the west or the US or Nato would act. Now Putin has established beyond doubt that there are no limits. Partly because of Iraq, and the fatigue it left behind, he has seen that   international talk of a “responsibility to protect” endangered civilians is a dead letter. You can kill hundreds of thousands and no one will do a thing. But 2016 has provided Putin with other reasons to be cheerful. He now has friends in high places, or in places about to get higher. The most obvious is Trump, but there are others, both near and far. Indeed, November was a banner month for the Russian leader, bringing   candidates to power in Moldova, Bulgaria and Estonia, as well as teeing up a   French presidential contest in 2017. There is a good chance the final round will pit two Putin fans against each other: François Fillon v Marine Le Pen. Like most on the European far right, Le Pen has long revered Putin as a nationalist strongman and was happy to take a €9m (£8m) loan from a   bank. Less predictably Fillon, who will be the standard bearer of the   also gazes   at Putin. Fillon wants to see the lifting of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine and believes Putin, the conqueror of Crimea, is the injured party, since it was all the western powers’ fault that Russia invaded in the first place. Wherever he looks, Putin can see allies  —   whether it’s Nigel Farage on the right or US Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein on the left. (Stein boasted during the campaign that she had dined with Russia’s leader, even sitting at the same table.) Indeed, given the regimes now ruling Hungary and Poland, Putin can smile at the emergence of what political scientist Yascha Mounk calls “the illiberal international” an arc of states led by people who, like him, regard the free press or an independent judiciary as unnecessary irritants. Yet democratic votes have been good to Putin this year. Brexit was an early gift to a man who has long seen the weakening of the European Union as a strategic goal. Ideally, he’d like to see the EU break up: then he could make a series of bilateral deals with Europe’s nations, picking them off one by one. That’s the long game but just to have the EU weakened, distracted and destabilised will do for now. And with Britain’s departure, the EU will lose one of its loudest   voices. But of course the sweetest victory came on 8 November. Donald Trump veered wildly during the campaign, but one of the few stances he maintained with iron consistency was his admiration for Putin. The autocrat certainly did all he could to return the favour. As one Kremlin ally puts it, “Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks. ” They certainly did. Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump. As a former KGB man, Putin must be proud of what is surely the most successful espionage operation in history, one that succeeded beyond even Moscow’s expectations  —   installing an admirer and sycophant in the White House. The benefits are obvious. Given Trump’s lukewarm commitment to Nato and the defence of its members, Putin will now have all but a free hand. As one Russia expert observes: “Seen from Moscow, the west has not been in such inviting disarray since the Suez crisis of 1956. Whatever constraints Putin may now feel upon his   instincts, Nato is no longer one of them. ” As the year closes, each day brings new delights for the master of the Kremlin. The US is about to be led by a serial, if not compulsive liar the public conversation of the west is polluted by fake news. This new,   world is pure Putinism. For years his propaganda effort, typified by his TV channel Russia Today, has been aimed not so much at pushing a single message as sowing confusion, making even solid facts seem unsteady. As a mission, it once seemed futile when pitted against the solid framework of fact and reason, carefully constructed during the two centuries since the enlightenment. But those timbers have proved alarmingly easy to rot. He may not have done all this himself. But it counts as a historic achievement nonetheless. If 2016 has been an awful year, and it has, then its true face belongs to Vladimir Putin.",donald trump name time magazin person year that make schoolboy error presum award badg moral approv know mere recognis individu domin previou month good time reason regret hand accolad adolf hitler even even though trump clearli biggest news stori still anoth figur loom larger annu horribili albeit shadow end year wolfish grin content almost dream come true that vladimir putin survey global landscap see almost everi sign point from aleppo white hous brexit year world reshap imag guid hand behind everi shift though certainli gave sever nudg togeth made biggest winner start syria even year horror sure merit special infami leader western nation ritual condemn catastroph visit upon peopl aleppo eloqu denounc bomb hospit includ makeshift clinic hidden basement flatten civilian area kill children denial food medicin putin know need listen becaus import fact ground stop syrian vassal bashar continu slaughter plenti warn aleppo guernica gener rememb among greatest crime human futur historian shame question outrag peopl know care anoth comparison aleppo receiv treatment putin mete grozni chechnya dare rebel moscow bomb call devast wasteland destruct toler deem take place russia turf facto permiss grant putin smash syria count even greater victori russian dictat advanc narrow strateg interest maintain presenc middl east tartu port access mediterranean less tangibl valuabl prize prove possibl kill dispossess million civilian impun cours georg bush prove invas iraq moscow might felt constrain preced slobodan milo fear limit much blood could shed eventu west nato would putin establish beyond doubt limit partli iraq fatigu left behind seen intern talk respons protect endang civilian dead letter kill hundr thousand thing provid putin reason cheer friend high place place higher obviou trump other near inde novemb banner month russian leader bring candid power moldova bulgaria estonia well tee french presidenti contest there good chanc final round putin fan fran fillon marin like european right long rever putin nationalist strongman happi take loan bank less predict fillon standard bearer also gaze putin fillon want lift sanction impos moscow ukrain believ putin conqueror crimea injur parti sinc western power fault russia invad first place wherev look putin alli whether nigel farag right green parti presidenti candid jill stein left stein boast campaign dine russia leader even sit tabl inde given regim rule hungari poland putin smile emerg polit scientist yascha mounk call illiber intern state peopl like regard free press independ judiciari unnecessari irrit democrat vote good putin year brexit earli gift long seen weaken european union strateg goal ideal like break could make seri bilater deal europ nation pick that long game weaken distract destabilis britain departur lose loudest voic cours sweetest victori came novemb donald trump veer wildli campaign stanc maintain iron consist admir putin autocrat certainli could return favour kremlin alli put mayb help wikileak they certainli credibl sourc doubt russia behind hack intern democrat parti email whose releas julian assang time caus maximum pain hillari clinton pleasur trump former putin must proud sure success espionag oper histori succeed beyond even moscow expect instal admir sycoph white hous benefit obviou given trump lukewarm commit nato defenc member putin free hand russia expert observ seen moscow west invit disarray sinc suez crisi whatev constraint putin feel upon instinct nato longer year close bring delight master kremlin serial compuls liar public convers west pollut fake news thi world pure putin year propaganda effort typifi channel russia today aim much push singl messag sow confus make even solid fact seem unsteadi mission seem futil pit solid framework fact reason care construct centuri sinc enlighten timber prove alarmingli easi done count histor achiev nonetheless aw year true face belong vladimir putin
146,Rewriting the Qur’an: Kader Abdolah and his controversial interpretation of Islam’s holy book,"“It is impossible to translate the Qur’an,” writes Kader Abdolah, at the start of his translation of the Qur’an. Prior to   Abdolah  —   then a popular émigré Iranian novelist in the Netherlands  —   had never even read the Qur’an, despite being raised in a Muslim family. But with the fall of the twin towers came the necessity to do so the new focus on Islamic extremism in the West meant that suddenly everyone had opinions about the book, although most had not read it. As a leading voice in the liberal Netherlands, Abdolah was expected to have a view. When Abdolah read the Qur’an for the first time, he read it as a novelist: in it he recognised not only a text of faith, but also a work of literature of such elegance and style that it had the potential to speak to writers all over the world. His Dutch translation was published in 2008 alongside The Messenger, a novelisation of Muhammad’s life intended to be read before tackling the holy book the pair were immediate bestsellers. Eight years on, they can now be read in English, thanks to translators Nouri and Niusha Nighting. So how does one tackle a task as weighty as translating a religious text? Something must be lost in the transition from Qur’anic Arabic to first Dutch and now English. Abdolah laments the loss of “the beauty” “the flavour, smell and feelings” of Muhammad’s language: in his introduction, he declares that he “knows nothing” and that he has made many mistakes. On first impression, these statements could suggest an understandable fear of backlash Abdolah’s translation, which alters, cuts and adds to the original text, could appear sacrilegious. However, Abdolah’s statements reflect not fear, but reverence  —   his respect for Muhammad’s original prose. Abdolah sees himself not as a translator but as an interpreter. Prioritising accessibility over religious mystery, Abdolah makes several weighty, and perhaps controversial, changes. The original compilers of the Qur’an ordered the suras   or chapters  —   by length, making the text difficult to navigate, in order to reflect something of the unfathomable nature of Allah. Instead, Abdolah reorders the suras into a chronological order, allowing for Muhammad’s journey to be traced alongside the story explained in The Messenger.  In his most bold move, Abdolah also adds an extra sura  —   number 115  —   in which Muhammad’s death is described. This addition, Abdolah explained in a recent interview with the Guardian, emphasises the importance of Muhammad in the Qur’an, a book usually attributed solely to Allah. Abdolah wished to bring into focus the “writer” of the Qur’an, a man who was a “dreamer” and “poet”. This addition, however, was also for Abdolah himself: “The last chapter is mine. Three people have written this book: Allah, Muhammad and Kader Abdolah. ” The frequent repetition, intended for the mostly illiterate audience of Muhammad’s time, is omitted in Abdolah’s translation. He also omits the Arabic alphabet letters that begin some of the suras, believed by some to be part of the Qur’an’s “sacred code” a mathematical structure that proves it was not written by humans. But if the Qur’an has lost anything in this rewriting, The Messenger provides new context, enabling   readers to approach the Qur’an with an otherwise impossible level of familiarity. The Messenger’s narrator is Zayd ibn Thalith, Muhammad’s adopted son, who sets out to chronicle the life of his father. Zayd’s unique position in Muhammad’s life humanises him we read of Muhammad’s illiteracy, his messy handwriting (“Hard to decipher. Like the scribbles of a child”) and his   when waiting to receive messages from Allah (“Who was Muhammad anyway? He was an orphan nobody wanted”). Muhammad becomes someone we can sympathise with and relate to.  The two books work in tandem, The Messenger providing context and story the Qur’an, poetry and mystery. But The Messenger also allows for discussion of Muhammad’s more problematic behaviour  —   like the episode in the Qur’an where, at the height of his power, he burns the trees and fields of the Jews and exiles them from Medina. In The Messenger, Zayd speaks to a rabbi who angrily exclaims, “no prophet ever used as much violence as your Muhammad [  …    ] he ravished young women and thought up suras to justify eliminating us. ” As time passes, Muhammad the prophet becomes a politician, a warlord, a conqueror. Abdolah does not deny Muhammad’s violence, instead arguing that such violence is inherent to political leadership. “[Muhammad] has done the same thing many leaders do. The same as Bush, [  …    ] Obama, [  …    ] Churchill,” he told the Guardian. “Even if they are good people, they have [started] big, big wars and they have used violence. ” The controversies of Abdolah’s project cannot be denied and have not been: in many countries, publishers have published The Messenger but rejected Abdolah’s Qur’an, for fear of a backlash. But considering the increase of Islamophobia in the West, there has arguably never been a more important time for moderate, analytical Islamic voices to be heard. Abdolah says he is “not afraid” of reprisals by extremists: “If those crazy people want to kill me, let them kill me. It is an honour to be killed for literature. ” Abdolah believes that the Qur’an, like other holy books, is not inherently violent or dangerous. “It is a dangerous book if you use it as [a set of] rules,” Abdolah says, but as literature, it is “beautiful. ”",imposs translat write kader abdolah start translat prior abdolah popular migr iranian novelist netherland never even read despit rais muslim famili fall twin tower came necess focu islam extrem west meant suddenli everyon opinion book although read lead voic liber netherland abdolah expect view when abdolah read first time read novelist recognis text faith also work literatur eleg style potenti speak writer world dutch translat publish alongsid messeng novelis muhammad life intend read tackl holi book pair immedi bestsel eight year read english thank translat nouri niusha night tackl task weighti translat religi text someth must lost transit anic arab first dutch english abdolah lament loss beauti flavour smell feel muhammad languag introduct declar know noth made mani mistak first impress statement could suggest understand fear backlash abdolah translat alter cut add origin text could appear sacrilegi howev abdolah statement reflect fear rever respect muhammad origin prose abdolah see translat interpret prioritis access religi mysteri abdolah make sever weighti perhap controversi chang origin compil order sura chapter length make text difficult navig order reflect someth unfathom natur allah instead abdolah reorder sura chronolog order allow muhammad journey trace alongsid stori explain messeng bold move abdolah also add extra sura number muhammad death describ thi addit abdolah explain recent interview guardian emphasis import muhammad book usual attribut sole allah abdolah wish bring focu writer dreamer poet thi addit howev also abdolah last chapter mine three peopl written book allah muhammad kader abdolah frequent repetit intend mostli illiter audienc muhammad time omit abdolah translat also omit arab alphabet letter begin sura believ part sacr code mathemat structur prove written human lost anyth rewrit messeng provid context enabl reader approach otherwis imposs level familiar messeng narrat zayd thalith muhammad adopt set chronicl life father zayd uniqu posit muhammad life humanis read muhammad illiteraci messi handwrit hard deciph like scribbl child wait receiv messag allah muhammad anyway orphan nobodi want muhammad becom someon sympathis relat book work tandem messeng provid context stori poetri mysteri messeng also allow discuss muhammad problemat behaviour like episod height power burn tree field jew exil medina messeng zayd speak rabbi angrili exclaim prophet ever use much violenc muhammad ravish young women thought sura justifi elimin time pass muhammad prophet becom politician warlord conqueror abdolah deni muhammad violenc instead argu violenc inher polit leadership muhammad done thing mani leader bush obama churchil told guardian even good peopl start war use violenc controversi abdolah project cannot deni mani countri publish publish messeng reject abdolah fear backlash consid increas islamophobia west arguabl never import time moder analyt islam voic heard abdolah say afraid repris extremist crazi peopl want kill kill honour kill literatur abdolah believ like holi book inher violent danger danger book rule abdolah say literatur beauti
147,Refugees on Nauru and Manus Island may be resettled in US,"The Turnbull government has given its strongest signal yet that a deal is in the wind with the United States to settle 1, 800 refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. The Australian newspaper reported Australia and the US were expected to announce the resettlement arrangement within days. Speculation has been mounting about a deal since Australia announced at Barack Obama’s global migration summit in New York in September that it would take refugees from camps in Costa Rica. Since then, the Coalition government has introduced legislation to place a lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have arrived by boat from ever travelling to Australia once they are resettled in other countries.  The defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, would not confirm the deal but he said if it did happen it would be a win for the government. “If it’s the case, it will be another great achievement from the Turnbull government,” he said on Channel Nine. Pyne said there was plenty of time to make an announcement before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president on 20 January.  Trump said he would put a blanket ban on Muslim immigration and then “suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies”. Among those on Manus and Nauru are people from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Iraq. There are some who are stateless. Some refugees and asylum seekers expressed their support for the potential deal. Many have spent years in the offshore processing system and, unless they have family in Australia, no longer desire to come to Australia. They still say they cannot go home, but because of the treatment they have received  —   for which they blame the Australian government  —   many are asking for refuge from any other   signatory. Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian journalist detained on Manus Island, told Guardian Australia he was sceptical of the reports but most other detainees he had spoken to would be happy to go to the US. “Be sure that most people would love to go to America, but some people need to join their families in Australia,” he said. “I think Australia has to respect them because they want to join their families. ” Hundreds of men are currently involved in court action in Papua New Guinea, seeking compensation for their detention which the PNG supreme court ruled illegal and unconstitutional this year. “For me it’s hard to accept to go to America because [the Australian government] has tortured me for about four years, and now to say ‘go to America’ I question the Australian government,” Boochani said. “How can I get what’s right from a country like Australia that violated my human rights?” Another said he would like to go to the US, but not before he was compensated for his treatment. The Iranian refugee, who did not wish to be named, has been physically assaulted twice since being detained on Manus Island. “They took my past three years of life. I was born in 1992 and when I arrived here I was almost 21 years,” he said. “Now I’m 24. I missed best days of my life to go and have fun or go to university or play sport. The Australian government keep me in indefinite detention. They have to pay for this. ” A young man held on Nauru said he had dreamed of coming to Australia and joining the defence forces, but he believed the US was a good option.  Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said a deal would be a good thing. “These are people who are refugees, who have been found to be refugees, who, if they are settled in a country like the United States, that will be a good thing,” he said. Kon Karapanagiotidis, the chief executive of the asylum seeker resource centre, said the deal sounded positive but he was waiting for details on whether it would include all refugees on the island, and how quickly the transfer would happen. “From day one it’s always been about safely resettling people who are seeking safety,” he told Guardian Australia. “We know that’s not possible on Nauru and we know that’s not possible in PNG. ” Karapanagiotidis said their preference had been to have people settled in Australia because they were Australia’s responsibility, but “if there is a deal to resettle all of them safely, quickly, in America, in a country where they will in fact be safe and settled, that’s our priority. ” “The most important thing is that it’s done quickly and urgently given the imminent danger and risk and the extreme poor state of physical and mental health of so many of them. ” He said he wasn’t interested in politics, but all credit for any deal would go to groups and individuals who had campaigned against the camps for years rather than to the government, which he feared may use the deal as a Senate bargaining chip for its visa ban legislation. The Coalition has refused to comment or speculate on potential   negotiations to resettle the refugees. On Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday, the prime minister maintained his silence on the issue. “There’s always speculation about these things . .. and we never comment on them,” he said. The Coalition’s latest migration bill, which would impose a lifetime ban on an estimated 3, 100 people, has passed the lower house of parliament but is yet to clear the Senate.  Labor, Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan, Greens MP Adam Bandt and Nick Xenophon Team MP  Rebekha Sharkie voted against the bill in the lower house. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the government had support for the bill amongst the Senate crossbench. He would need eight of the 10 remaining crossbenchers to pass the bill.",turnbul govern given strongest signal deal wind unit state settl refuge nauru manu island australian newspap report australia expect announc resettl arrang within day specul mount deal sinc australia announc barack obama global migrat summit york septemb would take refuge camp costa rica sinc coalit govern introduc legisl place lifetim asylum seeker arriv boat ever travel australia resettl countri defenc industri minist christoph pyne would confirm deal said happen would govern case anoth great achiev turnbul govern said channel nine pyne said plenti time make announc inaugur donald trump presid januari trump said would blanket muslim immigr suspend immigr area world proven histori terror unit state europ alli among manu nauru peopl lanka pakistan bangladesh iraq there stateless some refuge asylum seeker express support potenti deal mani spent year offshor process system unless famili australia longer desir come australia they still cannot home treatment receiv blame australian govern mani ask refug signatori behrouz boochani iranian journalist detain manu island told guardian australia sceptic report detaine spoken would happi sure peopl would love america peopl need join famili australia said think australia respect want join famili hundr current involv court action papua guinea seek compens detent suprem court rule illeg unconstitut year hard accept america australian govern tortur four year america question australian govern boochani said right countri like australia violat human right anoth said would like compens treatment iranian refuge wish name physic assault twice sinc detain manu island they took past three year life born arriv almost year said miss best day life univers play sport australian govern keep indefinit detent they young held nauru said dream come australia join defenc forc believ good option labor frontbench anthoni albanes said deal would good thing these peopl refuge found refuge settl countri like unit state good thing said karapanagiotidi chief execut asylum seeker resourc centr said deal sound posit wait detail whether would includ refuge island quickli transfer would happen from alway safe resettl peopl seek safeti told guardian australia know possibl nauru know possibl karapanagiotidi said prefer peopl settl australia australia respons deal resettl safe quickli america countri fact safe settl prioriti import thing done quickli urgent given immin danger risk extrem poor state physic mental health mani said interest polit credit deal would group individu campaign camp year rather govern fear deal senat bargain chip visa legisl coalit refus comment specul potenti negoti resettl refuge melbourn radio station friday prime minist maintain silenc issu there alway specul thing never comment said coalit latest migrat bill would impos lifetim estim peopl pass lower hous parliament clear senat labor andrew wilki cathi mcgowan green adam bandt nick xenophon team rebekha sharki vote bill lower hous immigr minist peter dutton said govern support bill amongst senat crossbench would need eight remain crossbench pass bill
148,Erdoğan refuses to rule out execution of failed Turkey coup leaders,"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has refused to rule out executing the ringleaders of last week’s failed coup, despite repeated warnings from western leaders who said the use of the death penalty would end Turkish hopes of joining the European Union. “The people have the opinion that these terrorists should be killed,” Erdoğan said in interview for CNN on Monday night. “Why should I keep them and feed them in prisons for years to come? That’s what the people say. ” Erdoğan said the final decision lay with parliament and that “as the president, I will approve any decision to come out of the parliament”. Some fear that Erdoğan may be using the backlash against the plot’s architects as a smokescreen for a wider crackdown on other political opponents. Erdoğan’s allies said measures taken by the government were a necessary and justified response to a coup attempt that had almost toppled an elected administration, left the parliament badly damaged and killed hundreds of civilians. Erdoğan was nevertheless accused of mission creep, with almost 9, 000 policemen, 30 regional governors and more than 50 senior civil servants dismissed since Friday and more than 7, 500 people arrested.  The detainees included more than 6, 000 soldiers and 103 generals and admirals  —   just under a third of the military’s high command. Arrest warrants were still out for 2, 700 judges, and all 3 million civil servants have been given travel bans amid government fears that some plotters within the deep state might attempt to flee. One journalist was listed for arrest, and by some estimates 20 news websites critical of the government had been shut down. Responding to the widening crackdown, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, urged the Turkish government to “uphold the highest standards of respect for the nation’s democratic institutions and the rule of law. We will certainly support bringing the perpetrators of the coup to justice, but we also caution against a reach that goes well beyond that. ” Speaking in Brussels, where he met European foreign ministers including the UK’s new foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, Kerry said Turkey would have to provide evidence that “withstands scrutiny” if it requested the extradition of the   cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan has blamed for the attempted coup. As Turkish authorities consider restoring the death penalty  —   outlawed in 2004  —   in response to the coup attempt, the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, stressed that such a move would rule out EU membership. “No country can become an EU member state if it introduces the death penalty,” she said, noting that Turkey was a member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European convention on human rights, which bans capital punishment. A spokeman for German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the EU was a “community of values, therefore the institution of the death penalty can only mean that such a country could not be a member. We categorically reject the death penalty and an institution of the death penalty would mean an end to the negotiations to join the EU. ” he said. A statement from EU foreign ministers called for “the full observance of Turkey’s constitutional order” but missing was any mention of a refugee pact struck between Turkey and the EU this year. That agreement hinges on   access for Turks to Europe’s     zone, but has run into trouble as Erdoğan has refused to change Turkey’s   laws, a key condition of joining the EU. The French foreign minister,   Ayrault, said Turkey was a “strategic partner” but had to respect fundamental liberties. “After the failure of the attempted military coup, the response must not be less democracy in Turkey but more democracy,” he said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, in an unusually sharply worded statement, said it was “essential for Turkey, like all other allies, to ensure full respect for democracy and its institutions, the constitutional order, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms”. While Erdoğan and his allies have amplified the sense of an authoritarian crackdown by publicly using language such as “purge” and “cleansing” to describe the government reaction, Turkish officials on Monday expressed frustration at western criticism. They view the crackdown as a legitimate response. One Turkish official said those arrested or fired either were clearly involved in the coup or had known ties with those who led it. “I understand that the numbers seem excessive, but right now this is about preventing the next wave of attacks against civilians and government buildings,” he said. “Obviously, the courts will consider evidence and reach their verdicts. ” He added: “I am starting to feel that we are ignoring the fact that the parliament was hit 11 times by hijacked F16s. ” Elsewhere in Turkey, some argued that the crackdown was expanding far beyond its acceptable remit. Among Turkish journalists, who were already the subject of a backlash prior to the coup attempt, there were rumours of an imminent series of arrests. At least one arrest warrant was formally issued  —   for Haberdar’s Ankara correspondent, Arzu Yıldız.  In an online statement, Yıldız said she had no connection to the coup attempt. “I do not even know the names of these soldiers and generals,” she wrote. Andrew Finkel, the   of P24, an initiative that supports independent Turkish media, said the pressure on journalists had “obviously gone up a notch since the [failed] coup”.  He added: “It’s basically because they can. There are all these dissident news sites that have been very critical of the government, and they want to shut them. ” Other analysts were less certain about the scope of the crackdown. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, Turkey analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former columnist in the Turkish media, said: “They’re paranoid and they’re cracking down on people they think were affiliated with Gülenists. But I don’t think they’re going to go after leftwing unionists that traditionally oppose AKP [Erdogan’s party] or Kurds. ” Aydıntaşbaş added: “That’s not to say that the crackdown is based on the rule of law, but as widespread as it looks, I think it is still linked to people who are presumed to be  . ” Life has continued relatively normally in Turkey since Saturday morning, but the country is still on edge. The government has called for its supporters to remain in the streets in a show of strength to deter conspirators who remain at large. Searches for suspects continued in several cities, and on Monday a man was killed outside an Ankara courthouse after reportedly firing on security forces. In Istanbul, the deputy mayor of a central district was shot in his office.",turkish presid recep tayyip erdo refus rule execut ringlead last week fail coup despit repeat warn western leader said death penalti would turkish hope join european union peopl opinion terrorist kill erdo said interview monday night keep feed prison year come that peopl erdo said final decis parliament presid approv decis come parliament some fear erdo use backlash plot architect smokescreen wider crackdown polit oppon erdo alli said measur taken govern necessari justifi respons coup attempt almost toppl elect administr left parliament badli damag kill hundr civilian erdo nevertheless accus mission creep almost policemen region governor senior civil servant dismiss sinc friday peopl arrest detaine includ soldier gener admir third militari high command arrest warrant still judg million civil servant given travel ban amid govern fear plotter within deep state might attempt flee journalist list arrest estim news websit critic govern shut respond widen crackdown secretari state john kerri urg turkish govern uphold highest standard respect nation democrat institut rule certainli support bring perpetr coup justic also caution reach goe well beyond speak brussel european foreign minist includ foreign secretari bori johnson kerri said turkey would provid evid withstand scrutini request extradit cleric fethullah erdo blame attempt coup turkish author consid restor death penalti outlaw respons coup attempt foreign polici chief federica mogherini stress move would rule membership countri becom member state introduc death penalti said note turkey member council europ signatori european convent human right ban capit punish spokeman german chancellor angela merkel said commun valu therefor institut death penalti mean countri could member categor reject death penalti institut death penalti would mean negoti join said statement foreign minist call full observ turkey constitut order miss mention refuge pact struck turkey year that agreement hing access turk europ zone troubl erdo refus chang turkey law condit join french foreign minist ayrault said turkey strateg partner respect fundament liberti after failur attempt militari coup respons must less democraci turkey democraci said nato secretari gener jen stoltenberg unusu sharpli word statement said essenti turkey like alli ensur full respect democraci institut constitut order rule fundament freedom while erdo alli amplifi sens authoritarian crackdown publicli use languag purg cleans describ govern reaction turkish offici monday express frustrat western critic they view crackdown legitim respons turkish offici said arrest fire either clearli involv coup known tie understand number seem excess right prevent next wave attack civilian govern build said obvious court consid evid reach verdict ad start feel ignor fact parliament time hijack elsewher turkey argu crackdown expand beyond accept remit among turkish journalist alreadi subject backlash prior coup attempt rumour immin seri arrest least arrest warrant formal issu haberdar ankara correspond arzu onlin statement said connect coup attempt even know name soldier gener wrote andrew finkel initi support independ turkish media said pressur journalist obvious gone notch sinc fail coup ad basic there dissid news site critic govern want shut other analyst less certain scope crackdown turkey analyst european council foreign relat former columnist turkish media said they paranoid crack peopl think affili lenist think go leftw unionist tradit oppos erdogan parti kurd ad that crackdown base rule widespread look think still link peopl presum life continu rel normal turkey sinc saturday morn countri still edg govern call support remain street show strength deter conspir remain larg search suspect continu sever citi monday kill outsid ankara courthous reportedli fire secur forc istanbul deputi mayor central district shot offic
149,"Macaulay Culkin: ‘No, I was not pounding six grand of heroin a month’","Of all modern myths, it is the fall of the child star that most compels us. Whether they’re embarking on   marriages, throwing bongs out of windows or abandoning monkeys at customs, we can’t seem to get enough. There’s something pathological in our need to tear down our icons of innocence, which might explain the overprotective nature of Macaulay Culkin’s US publicist, who wants to see all my questions upfront. I refuse. I thought we could just . .. have a chat? The interview, Culkin’s biggest in 10 years, is supposed to focus on his comeback. I’m instructed to avoid anything negative. I ask if I can ask if he has any regrets. “Regrets sounds too negative,” is the response. When we meet, in the lobby of a hotel in Spain, I’m still trying to figure out what exactly this comeback consists of. Culkin’s filming an advert for Compare the Market, which is obviously not a passion project. “It was fun, and we hammered that sucker out pretty quickly. The biggest scene was me sitting on a bench eating  . ” Is he doing this to fund an exciting new venture? “No, not necessarily. ” He’s dressed grungily, long hair   back, boots   blazer  . He doesn’t project the focused careerism of most actors. “People feel they have to be in perpetual motion, or drown. I’ve never had a problem saying I’ve got nothing lined up. Maybe I’ll take the next year off. ” It sounds as if he’s not particularly drawn to acting at all. “I’m not much active,” he concedes. “If I knew what I wanted to do, I’d be writing it myself. ” The trajectory of Culkin’s life feels like fallout from an atomic blast. By the age of 12, Uncle Buck, two Home Alone films, My Girl and (to a lesser extent) Richie Rich had made him the most successful child actor of all time. At 14, he became legally emancipated from his parents both had been trying to gain control of his $17m fortune in their divorce. Culkin married at 17, and separated two years later. Sleepovers with Michael Jackson became public knowledge when he was called as a defence witness at the singer’s molestation trial. I’m ghoulishly fascinated by this alien childhood. I’d like to ask about Michael Jackson. “I think it’s best you don’t,” interjects his manager. She is one of three people sitting with us. “It’s not that it’s a painful topic . .. ” begins Culkin. His manager insists we move on, the PR next to her agrees. Culkin clearly wants to say something, but six eyes are telling him not to. I suspect we’re both wondering why we’re here    Culkin doesn’t do this sort of thing any more, having turned his back on the spotlight. “I don’t just turn my back, I actively don’t want it. The paps go after me because I don’t whore myself out. ” He has spent a decade turning down interviews, and mostly lives in France, where the aloof Parisians leave him alone. (It’s also where Kevin McCallister’s family were headed when they left him Home Alone, but we can’t talk about that.) I get the impression he’s as eager to talk about a price comparison website as I am to ask about one. Instead, I ask why people are still fascinated by him. “I have no idea. I was thinking about this the other day  —   I’d crossed the wrong street, picked up a tail, suddenly there’s a crush of 20 paparazzi. Then people with cameraphones get involved. I don’t think I’m worthy of that. ” Has it got better with time? “It’s been like that my whole adult life. You take on a   attitude, always scanning the horizon. It’s strange on dates, as it looks like you’re not paying attention. But I’ve stopped trying to think of myself in the third person, because that’s just gonna drive me nuts. ” You had to think about yourself in the third person? “Exactly. Macaulay Culkin is out there, and I’m Mac. You guys can play with the first one. ” He’s not averse to a bit of playing himself, for Culkin is the celebrity’s  . You may remember the   a few years back when Ryan Gosling was pictured wearing a   of Kevin McCallister. Culkin responded by creating a   that pictured Gosling wearing the shirt, before Gosling responded in kind, being photographed wearing a   of Culkin wearing a   of Gosling wearing a   of Culkin. They may still be at it for all we know. Culkin’s previous ads, for the likes of Orange (and, in a Partridge move, the rebranding of Norwich Union) trade in      . For Compare the Market, he plays a hitchhiker picked up by the lovable meerkats, who see him as a child, buying him   and making him ride    he’s too big for. In 2006, Culkin wrote an experimental novel, Junior, from the perspective of a certifiable child star with father issues. In web comedy :DRYVRS, he’s a   sadist, unhinged by the childhood trauma of parental abandonment, and defending himself against home invaders. Is all this   what he’s drawn to, or just what he gets offered? “A bit of both. It suits my personality and sense of humour. But I would be game for something   . ” Given this dilemma  —   constantly returning to a past he wants distance from  —   where does his sense of self come from? “From me. I try to figure out what makes me happy  —   and not in a superficial way. I keep my soul fit. ” Is he spiritual? “I know enough to know I don’t know. I was raised Catholic, so there’s a lot of guilt. We’re born with original sin. ” He veers off into a joke. “Since I was told that, I’ve been trying to come up with even more original sins, that’ll really blow my priest away at confession. Like, here’s one you haven’t heard  —   it involves a pitching wedge, a donkey and a bucket of ice. ” And two meerkats? “Yeah! You might wanna record this one!” He reflects. “Actually, I’m very much at peace lately. I can debate with people, and my heart rate never changes. ” And Culkin is witty and affable. Funny, but distant. He offers confrontational figures of speech amiably. “If you want to get into an argument with an artist, ask them what art is,” he says. “If you want to make an actor feel uncomfortable, ask them what they’re doing next. ” (I hastily scribble out one of the few questions I’ve written down.) Are his debates political? “I have leanings, but I’m the definition of a disenfranchised voter  —   I think the system is ugly. This whole Trump thing is amazing. ” (Trump cameos in Home Alone 2, showing our hero the way to the Plaza Hotel lobby, although we can’t talk about it.) Culkin doesn’t want to be drawn further. “Discussing politics is the quickest way to alienate people, so I don’t wanna go into it. ” And Trump has enough column inches? “Exactly! He’s like the Candyman, we have to stop saying his name. ” Culkin was acting at four, an age at which no one knows what they want beyond watching cartoons and eating oversugared cereal. Having described himself as “effectively retired” he works occasionally (voices for Seth Green’s Robot Chicken, cameoing as himself in Zoolander 2) but: “I’m much more proactive with visual arts and writing, my notebook and little projects. ” Of the projects that reach the public, most could charitably be classed as divisive. There are paintings: one of the cast of Seinfeld on the set of Wheel of Fortune, being painted, nude, by  . There’s The Wrong Ferrari, a Dadaist knockabout written on ketamine with Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches, shot entirely on iPhones. Most notorious is the Pizza Underground, his Velvet Underground tribute act that replaces the original lyrics with pizza puns (I’m Waiting for Delivery Man, Take a Bite of the Wild Slice). At Nottingham Rock City, the band were pelted with beer and booed off stage as he played a kazoo solo. They cancelled their European dates, citing a “cheesemergency”. My question about all this is: what the hell? “It’s one of those good ideas you have when you’re drunk, and you wake up and forget about it. But we’re taking it to the end of the joke. We have an album coming out, a vinyl pressing with a children’s choir, a symphony orchestra. We’re giving it away, our gift to the world. ” Does he still find it funny? “Of course I find it funny! We rhyme mushrooms with mushrooms, come on. It’s the same joke, relentlessly. Like, they’re really doing this?” Culkin enjoys the absurdity his fame bestows. But scrutiny has its downside. In New York, he takes walks at 4am to avoid harassment. On YouTube, one can find clips of him being harassed by   with smartphones. In 2012, photographs of him looking gaunt, almost transparent, set tabloids aflame with stories he was addicted to heroin and oxycodone, following the breakdown of his relationship with Mila Kunis. Given his friendship with Adam Green and Pete Doherty  —   as well as a previous arrest for possession of marijuana, Xanax and clonazepam  —   it seemed plausible. Were people right to be worried? “Not necessarily. Of course, when silly stuff is going on  —   but no, I was not pounding six grand of heroin every month or whatever. The thing that bugged me was tabloids wrapping it all in this weird guise of concern. No, you’re trying to shift papers. ” Is there a story there he might want to tell one day, on his own terms? “Perhaps. ” Whatever his recreational habits, I’m surprised by how   Macaulay Culkin is. Plans for the summer mainly involve roadying for Har Mar Superstar and Green (with whom he has another   film out, Aladdin). “Home is where my boots are. I’m a big fan of jumping on people’s tourbuses, making myself useful, doing   and outs. I do everything except the merch table. I tried that, but . .. we didn’t sell anything. ” He has directionless days. He sleeps in, stays up late, indulges immature humour, bounces around with   friends. In short, he’s enjoying the adolescence that celebrity stole from him. Ironically, his personal problems and turbulent relationship with the media have also given him a pretty   perspective. Not a bad epilogue for a child star. “It’s allowed me to become the person I am, and I like me, so I wouldn’t change a thing. Not having to do anything for my dinner, financially, lets me treat every gig like it’s the last. ” He laughs, and this time addresses himself in the second person. “If it is, I’d think: Culkin, you had a good run. ”",modern myth fall child star compel whether embark marriag throw bong window abandon monkey custom seem enough there someth patholog need tear icon innoc might explain overprotect

150,Will Wonder Woman be the movies’ first major queer superhero?,"The Twitter campaign to alter Captain America’s traditional sexuality was always going to be a struggle. In May, the hashtag #GiveCaptainAmericaaBoyfriend was trending like a Kardashian selfie on the social network. But given Chris Evans’ patriotic superhero has been shown to have feelings for both Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter and her   Sharon during his time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, such a major canonical shift always looked about as likely as Hulk agreeing to attend anger management sessions. And yet we’re certainly about due a queer superhero on the big screen. In the comics, Marvel has brought us gay   Mystique and Northstar, while DC gave one version of Green Lantern a boyfriend in 2012 and even introduced a transexual character in Gail Simone’s groundbreaking Batgirl run  —   though the publisher rather ruined its LGBTQ cred when a different writer later introduced, and was forced to apologise for, the deeply offensive trans villain Dagger Type. Of the above, only Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique is currently appearing in comic book movies, and there has been little indication the   take on the shapeshifting mutant has queer leanings. But for those hoping to see a little more diversity in superhero films, there is now a sliver of hope. For the writer of Wonder Woman’s current comic book adventures has confirmed what we pretty much all knew, that Princess Diana of Themyscira is bisexual. “Yes,” replied Greg Rucka when asked whether his revamped version of the Amazonian warrior was queer. “I think it’s more complicated though,” he said. “This is inherently the problem with Diana: we’ve had a long history of people  —   for a variety of reasons, including sometimes pure titillation, which I think is the worst reason  —   say, ‘Ooo. Look. It’s the Amazons. They’re gay!’ “And when you start to think about giving the concept of Themyscira its due, the answer is, ‘How can they not all be in same sex relationships?’ Right? It makes no logical sense otherwise. “It’s supposed to be paradise. You’re supposed to be able to live happily. You’re supposed to be able  —   in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner  —   to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women. But an Amazon doesn’t look at another Amazon and say, ‘You’re gay.’ They don’t. The concept doesn’t exist. ” Rucka’s right. No one should be too surprised that Wonder Woman likes women when she lives in a   feminist utopia. But there are also strong historical reasons why the superhero should be considered proudly queer. Wonder Woman was created in 1941 by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston, a famously leftfield, not to mention rather creepy, thinker on matters of sexuality and feminism who, as documented in Jill Lepore’s 2014 book The Secret History of Wonder Woman, lived in a menage a trois (and sometimes more) with his wife Elizabeth Holloway Marston (often considered the superhero’s  ) and their lover and cohabitant Olive Byrne. Both women have been cited as inspirations for the character, with Elizabeth believed to have contributed her famous phrase “Suffering Sappho!” and Olive her looks. Will Monster director Patty Jenkins, who’s overseeing the new Wonder Woman movie, be brave enough to incorporate her subject’s queer identity, thereby making her the first major   gay superhero? No one’s suggesting (and Rucka seems to be fiercely against) a   “I’m transexual, Barbara” moment, in the vein of Simone’s Batgirl run, but there are other more subtle ways to offer a sly nod to recent developments. Although Jenkins’ film wrapped in May, it surely wouldn’t require   reshoots for the   to shoehorn in, say, an early flashback scene hinting at the superhero’s youthful dalliances on Themyscira. Early trailers for Wonder Woman, along with Israeli actor Gal Gadot’s debut appearance as the Amazonian superhero in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, have given fans confidence that Jenkins’ take cleaves tightly to the character’s roots as a strong, empowered, independent woman. But it remains to be seen if Warner has the guts to really push the envelope, especially as the studio has cast Star Trek hunk Chris Pine as Diana’s traditional mortal love interest, Steve Trevor. One imagines the suits who helped ruin Suicide Squad (by handing the movie’s final edit to the guys behind the film’s startling trailers) might begin to get severely itchy fingers once again if Jenkins turns in a version in which Pine doesn’t get so much as a snog. Warner Bros got nothing but bad publicity from leering all over Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, but you have to wonder if the studio figured that it would add five   teenage boys for every fan who objected to all the shallow objectification. Likewise, celebrating Wonder Woman’s queer identity might seem like a risky marketing manoeuvre for a film that will be aiming to pick up the widest audience possible. On the other hand, there’s an argument that it makes no sense for   relationships to remain taboo for superhero movies in 2016 when the   children’s film franchise of   Harry Potter, achieved some its best box office results following JK Rowling’s 2007 revelation that Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore was gay. More recently, we learned that Gobber, the amputee viking from the How to Train Your Dragon movies also prefers men, without any real associated fuss.  By celebrating Diana of Themyscira’s bisexuality, DC would in one fell stroke leap ahead of rivals Marvel in the diversity stakes and guarantee itself a whopping share of the pink pound come opening weekend next June. There is an opportunity here, beyond doing the right thing and offering acolytes a sly nod to the superhero’s famously unorthodox gestation. And perhaps the Amazonian princess needs a little something extra to shout about, a genuine distinguishing mark, for us to hear her voice through the cacophony of   superheroes heading to screens over the next few years.  Never mind the lasso of truth, or her frickin’ invisible plane, as she prepares to hit the multiplexes for the first time in her own movie next year, a queer identity could end up being Wonder Woman’s new secret weapon.

151,"USA and Mexico soccer fans get on just fine, despite the awkward politics","The atmosphere and aura surrounding Mexico’s quadrennial trip to Columbus for World Cup qualifying are storied among American soccer fans. Columbus has been considered a fortress by US goalkeeper Tim Howard, who on Friday devoted a Players’ Tribune piece to describe just how much mystique surrounds the place when it comes to soccer.  The qualifiers in Columbus come with a mystique of their own, as each of the games  —   before Friday’s   win by Mexico, that is  —   had an identical   scoreline in favor of the US, prompting American fans to adopt the phrase Dos a Cero whenever they played Mexico. That Dos a Cero chant was audible on the way to the stadium as the American Outlaws marched through the narrow Columbus streets on the way to the stadium, banged on cars and got people to come out of their houses. That excitement carried on in the parking lot, where dozens of tailgates started up. Everyone seemed to be getting along. Despite the obvious disagreements over the election of Donald Trump, the mood inside and out of the stadium was carefree. American fans welcomed Mexican fans and took pictures with them. One Mexican family began randomly passing a ball with Americans fans they had just met. Vicente Tlahuextl, who said he traveled five hours from Indiana to watch the game, said the game was about soccer, not politics. “This is my first time in Columbus, first time here  —   I hope it’s a warm welcome by everyone,” he said. “Everyone loves each other, they call it the beautiful game for a reason. ” Inside Mapfre Stadium there was   joking among both sets of fans, but nothing of the kind that has popped up on previous occasions between these two teams. When Rafa Marquez buried the   header, the groupings of Mexican fans quickly let the Americans know it. But instead of hate or fighting breaking out, the stadium mostly just fell silente. No arrests, no incidents, just a meeting of two devout fan bases supporting their teams. Most Americans waded out of the stadium crestfallen after the loss but a few stuck around in the parking lot trying to wait out the traffic or just trying to take a little more in. Joe Crawford and his friend Chris, Columbus Crew   holders, have been to every incarnation of Dos a Cero in Columbus, but neither was impressed with Friday’s atmosphere. “This is the worst atmosphere I’ve ever been here for. It was terrible. It was bad,” Chris said. “This is the biggest sporting event in America in four years and you’re just going to sit here and golf clap? It’s unbelievable, and I don’t understand it. ” Crawford criticized the lottery system, and how Crew   holders were promised tickets to the   game at the beginning of the season  —   but it only entered them in lottery for tickets, which he believes made tickets easier to get for   fans. He also said that hardcore fans should have an advantage for games like this in order to provide a proper atmosphere for the team to be played in. “Clearly we are USA fans, we’re soccer fans. We’re Columbus Crew fans. We don’t have priority over these tickets?” Crawford said. “We get out in some sort of lottery? OK, we understand that, whatever. ” Most fans in attendance seemed to enjoy themselves despite the result and no violence has been reported. Perhaps the most telling moment came before the game, when the announcer gave the crowd the usual message of tolerance and acceptance, and no one person stood up to object. At least in the realm of this rivalry, acceptance and unity are truly being understood.",atmospher aura surround mexico quadrenni trip columbu world qualifi stori among american soccer fan columbu consid fortress goalkeep howard friday devot player tribun piec describ much mystiqu surround place come soccer qualifi columbu come mystiqu game friday mexico ident scorelin favor prompt american fan adopt phrase cero whenev play mexico that cero chant audibl stadium american outlaw march narrow columbu street stadium bang car peopl come hous that excit carri park dozen tailgat start everyon seem get along despit obviou disagr elect donald trump mood insid stadium carefre american fan welcom mexican fan took pictur mexican famili began randomli pass ball american fan vicent tlahuextl said travel five hour indiana watch game said game soccer polit thi first time columbu first time hope warm welcom everyon said everyon love call beauti game reason insid mapfr stadium joke among set fan noth kind pop previou occas team when rafa marquez buri header group mexican fan quickli american know instead hate fight break stadium mostli fell silent arrest incid meet devout base support team most american wade stadium crestfallen loss stuck around park tri wait traffic tri take littl crawford friend chri columbu crew holder everi incarn cero columbu neither impress friday atmospher thi worst atmospher ever terribl chri said thi biggest sport event america four year go golf clap unbeliev understand crawford critic lotteri system crew holder promis ticket game begin season enter lotteri ticket believ made ticket easier fan also said hardcor fan advantag game like order provid proper atmospher team play clearli fan soccer fan columbu crew fan prioriti ticket crawford said sort lotteri understand whatev most fan attend seem enjoy despit result violenc report perhap tell moment came game announc gave crowd usual messag toler accept person stood object least realm rivalri accept uniti truli understood
152,"You thought TTIP was dead? With Brexit we’ll get the same thing, on steroids","It was a fallacy that withdrawing from the EU would save us from the corporate power grab symbolised by TTIP. This week we’ve discovered that not only might another massive EU trade deal be imposed on us before we Brexit, but our whole trade strategy could be handed over to big finance, egged on by true believers in the free market within the Tory party. TTIP is short for the Transatlantic Trade  Investment Partnership, a   trade pact that declares war on environmental protection, workers’ rights and public services, and would allow big business to sue governments in secret tribunals for taking reasonable policy decisions such as putting cigarettes in plain packages. Thanks to one of the biggest   campaigns in history, TTIP is facing a very uncertain future. Supported by nearly 3. 5 million Europeans, the campaign has made TTIP “the most toxic acronym in Europe”. Negotiations have stalled, while politicians on both sides of the Atlantic lob verbal   at the agreement to shore up their domestic support. But what we definitely haven’t managed to do is kill off TTIP’s sister agreement known as CETA  —   a deal between the EU and Canada. CETA does everything TTIP threatens to do, giving big Canadian corporations (and US subsidiaries in Canada) huge power to take on European governments when they fail to toe the line. Unfortunately CETA is well progressed and could pass into law before Britain exits the EU. You might assume that when we Brexit we leave that all behind us, but according to advice from the legal expert Sam Fowles this week, CETA would remain in force for 20 years after we leave the EU. That’s 20 years of corporations taking British governments to task for passing laws and regulations designed to protect people and the planet. What’s more, our government has been working away behind the scenes to push CETA into effect before parliament has even had a chance to discuss the pact. No need to worry about the Brussels bureaucrats when you’re ruled by the most extreme   government in Europe. We now need to keep fighting to make sure they don’t get their way. CETA needs to be halted now  —   for our own sake and for our friends throughout Europe and Canada. But life gets scarier still. Newspapers and the airwaves are now filled by   fundamentalists who have waited decades to design a trade system unhindered by government: a true free market. If TTIP as a thing is close to death, TTIP as a way of thinking is alive and well and residing in England. Why grow food when they can grow it for us more cheaply in Africa? Why keep all these consumer and environmental protections when they simply obstruct the functioning of the market? A bonfire of regulation and taxes can begin  . It will be TTIP on steroids. It’s even being floated that we don’t need to worry about TTIP  —   we should just join straight up to   deals such as Nafta, which has seen Canada sued dozens of times in   secret courts for daring to enact environmental or health protection. Britain doesn’t have the trade officials to take forward this agenda  —   having only 20 trade negotiators compared with the EU’s 600. Not a problem  —   the government is reported to be considering paying top dollar to financial sector consultants such as PwC, Deloitte and KPMG to do it for us. The ultimate “contracting out” the privatisation of government decisions. The result is unlikely to be anything that resembles the British people “taking back control” of their country. Of course trade could be made to work to create a more equal world  —   supporting small producers, incentivising   products, facilitating a transfer of technology and skills necessary to meet human needs and fulfil human rights. But the only way to do this is ditch the   ideology that the market knows best, and embrace a world that exists for the maximisation of human welfare, recognising that this is the 21st century, not the 19th. But that won’t happen without one hell of a fight, and we are starting on the back foot. So let’s not put the TTIP placards in the storeroom just yet. The campaign against TTIP was just a dress rehearsal.",fallaci withdraw would save corpor power grab symbolis ttip thi week discov might anoth massiv trade deal impos brexit whole trade strategi could hand financ eg true believ free market within tori parti ttip short transatlant trade invest partnership trade pact declar environment protect worker right public servic would allow busi govern secret tribun take reason polici decis put cigarett plain packag thank biggest campaign histori ttip face uncertain futur support nearli million european campaign made ttip toxic acronym europ negoti stall politician side atlant verbal agreement shore domest support definit manag kill ttip sister agreement known ceta deal canada ceta everyth ttip threaten give canadian corpor subsidiari canada huge power take european govern fail line unfortun ceta well progress could pass britain exit might assum brexit leav behind accord advic legal expert fowl week ceta would remain forc year leav that year corpor take british govern task pass law regul design protect peopl planet what govern work away behind scene push ceta effect parliament even chanc discuss pact need worri brussel bureaucrat rule extrem govern europ need keep fight make sure ceta need halt sake friend throughout europ canada life get scarier still newspap airwav fill fundamentalist wait decad design trade system unhind govern true free market ttip thing close death ttip think aliv well resid england grow food grow cheapli africa keep consum environment protect simpli obstruct function market bonfir regul tax begin ttip steroid even float need worri ttip join straight deal nafta seen canada su dozen time secret court dare enact environment health protect britain trade offici take forward agenda trade negoti compar problem govern report consid pay dollar financi sector consult deloitt kpmg ultim contract privatis govern decis result unlik anyth resembl british peopl take back control countri cours trade could made work creat equal world support small produc incentivis product facilit transfer technolog skill necessari meet human need fulfil human right ditch ideolog market know best embrac world exist maximis human welfar recognis centuri happen without hell fight start back foot ttip placard storeroom campaign ttip dress rehears
153,Guardian Canada Week: what it is and how you can be involved,"Last week, Barack Obama declared: “The world needs more Canada”. We couldn’t agree more  —   but what exactly is Canada? Robin Williams once responded in an online chat to a Canadian who asked him for a hug: “You are the kindest country in the world. You are like a really nice apartment over a meth lab. ” And so goes the country’s image  —   a settled oasis of clean streets and firm handshakes and shirts buttoned to the neck, as America seethes underneath in a maelstrom of gun violence, pollution and garbage strikes. But a closer look reveals that Vancouver is buzzing with barely disguised fury against an influx of hot Chinese cash. Calgary is locked in a struggle against the very thing that made it rich, the car. Montreal is still reeling from the corruption fiasco that was the 1976 Olympics. In Toronto the former mayor’s popularity only went up after he admitted that the footage his drug dealer snuck of him smoking crack in the dealer’s basement was not, in fact, fake. And let’s not forget the gun violence, pollution and garbage strikes. So to unearth the contradictions and get under the skin of this complicated place, Guardian Cities is focusing on Canada for a week of   reporting. Oui! We’re looking hard at five Canadian cities over five days, starting today by examining why Toronto will be to the 21st century what Chicago was to the 20th, and continuing throughout the week with   reporting on the stories gripping the country’s cities. We’ll also look at some ideas currently resonating across the nation, from multiculturalism to the death of street hockey, and the struggle of First Nations to find their place in Canada’s urban environment. Jay Baruchel reports on the sibling rivalry with the US, Cadence Weapon bares how he feels about how   killed guitars when it comes to Canada’s urban musical identity, Karen Geier has delineated the psychological tribes of Canada’s cities, our Instagrammers have shot the surprisingly unique graffiti of St John’s   …     and we’ll have a deceptively difficult urban quiz.   No matter where you are or how big or small your community, we want you to share your perspectives with us. What are the best  —   and worst  —   things about Canadian city life? How do you feel about Canada’s future? Bust some myths for us, lift the lid, celebrate, criticise, poke fun, praise: it’s over to you.

154,Migrants break through Italian police barriers to enter France,"More than 100 migrants have broken through police barriers at the Italian border town of Ventimiglia and made their way into France, the local Italian police chief said.  They stopped on rocks near the port at the French Riviera town of Menton after breaking through on Friday afternoon and were still there in the evening under the surveillance of French police, said the Ventimiglia police commander, Giorgio Marenco.  “Both the Italian and French forces at the border were taken by surprise,” Marenco told Reuters. The French interior ministry and representatives of the   region around Menton were not available for comment.  A video posted on the website of Nice Matin newspaper showed a stream of people picking their way across rocks, followed by police in riot gear. A few started to walk into the sea.  It was not immediately clear how they got past police cordons. Many of the hundreds of migrants who arrive in Italy by boat every day aim for northern Europe. Ventimiglia’s craggy seashore became the site of a temporary migrant camp last year, which was later cleared away by police. Most of the estimated 94, 000 people who have arrived in Italy by boat this year travelled from   Africa to Libya where people smugglers, who have taken advantage of the breakdown of order there, charged them hundreds of dollars for the passage, often in unseaworthy boats.  The city of about 24, 000 residents opened a reception centre to house the hundreds of migrants who had been sleeping rough under a bridge. About 150 migrants left the centre shortly after midnight on Thursday and walked to the shore, where they remained for hours before heading for France.  “The migrants who have reached Ventimiglia over the past three years have one aim: to pass into France,” Marenco said.

155,Young Thug’s airport rant reveals a misogynist in a dress,"Last week, a video surfaced of Young Thug berating two black female airline workers for not allowing him to board a flight he was late for. In the footage, he calls the women “bum ass hoes” “ants” and “peasants”. As they turn their backs to the camera he chuckles, informing the viewer that their hair is “nappy as a motherfucker” and that they looked like “Africans” that had “been deported”. Later on, he clarified in a tweet that his comments hadn’t been an indictment on all black women, rather just those “two black, burnt” ones. The backlash was swift and incongruously culminated in a brief interview with Paper on 12 December in which he spoke about “the fight against poverty”. But amid the anger was an overriding sense of disappointment. It was as if it was a surprise to find Young Thug reverting to the egotistical, misogynistic braggadocio present in his entire discography. For some time now, Young Thug has been posited as the poster child for progression within rap. His “carefree black boy” aesthetic made him a   darling and a mascot for an emerging wave of renaissance rappers. Gushing profiles rattled on about his services to   with little mention of anything else besides his outfits. It’s troubling how the bar is set so low that he has been lauded for changing rap without really changing anything other than his clothes. It’s as if critics couldn’t hear the tired misogyny and hypermasculinity in his music over the sound of their own applause for his breaking of barriers. “I got 50 foreign hoes on my dick   I’m a nut in all ’em hoes” “She ain’t gettin’ shit unless she suckin’ dick” “She suck on that dick on the   And I just called her airhead” among other equally demeaning lines, come from a man apparently changing the game for the better.  In a recent Calvin Klein campaign, the rapper made   comments denouncing gender: “In my world, of course, it doesn’t matter. You could be a gangster with a dress, you could be a gangster with baggy pants,” he mused. “I feel like there’s no such thing as gender. ” In similarly   moves, he wore a pretty periwinkle gown on the cover of his Jeffery mixtape and modelled a piece from the Calvin Klein women’s collection in a polarising ad. The very same gender he claims not to buy into was swiftly weaponised, though, when he began referring to women as “hoes”. Gender also matters when, in his music, women only exist on bended knee and voiceless. This isn’t an attempt to undermine the effect his outfit choices have had on the scene. He’s received his fair share of stick for how he dresses and has been a victim of homophobia from the public and his peers. His attire may be a pushback against the toxic masculinity often present in the genre, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t just as toxic. Painfully, the very black women he denigrates have been those continually championing his flamboyance. And though we are by now used to raising glasses in clubs to songs about how little we mean to the men whose pockets we continually line, his denigration stings far more than others. The disappointment lies in the fact that he was billed as an eccentric, effeminate exception from the usual  . The problem is, he never really was.  Heralded as the new face of more inclusive rap, he is merely the old face in fancy new clothes. He said it himself: “You can still be a gangster in a dress”. A costume change is easier than a change of content. Patriarchal strictures stay entirely unchallenged, women remain nothing more than canvases for cum shots. But hey, the new dress code is fabulous.

156,"First Thiel, now the Trumps: how billionaires threaten free speech","Less than 24 hours after Gawker. com was killed by billionaire Peter Thiel’s legal crusade against it, another billionaire couple  —   Donald and Melania Trump  —   is already using the same law firm Thiel did to threaten more media organizations into silence. And this time, it could have a direct effect on the presidential election. The Guardian reported late on Monday night that Melania Trump’s lawyers have sent threatening letters and are considering filing lawsuits against a variety of media organizations  —   including the Daily Mail, Politico and the Week  —   for reporting on rumors of Melania Trump’s past, including her alleged immigration status when she came to the United States. This is the quintessential example of the disturbing precedent Peter Thiel has just set by creating a blueprint for billionaires to destroy news organizations they do not like. He has shown that all they need is a little persistence. And in a media landscape that is increasingly dominated by the rich and powerful, that should give even Gawker’s most ardent critics pause. We know Donald Trump and others have gone down this path before. Trump has openly bragged about the fact that he sued a former New York Times reporter in the early aughts for the purpose of trying to hit the reporter involved financially. Trump did lose that lawsuit, but not until after litigation that undoubtedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for the winning party.  And if you think the Trumps are litigious now, just wait until after November. Peter Scheer, director of the First Amendment coalition, explained the consequences of the Gawker case succinctly:  Say five years from now, if Trump loses and people are writing critical postmortems, will they have to worry that Trump will turn around and sue them? Because of the Gawker trial, I fear that many journalists will wonder, “Could that happen to me, even in writing about Trump?” They will be censoring themselves. That is the worst outcome here, and it’s quite likely. But Trump is not the only culprit. In yet another ominous example, Mother Jones, the liberal nonprofit magazine known for its investigative journalism, spent millions of dollars in legal fees when another billionaire, Frank VanderSloot, sued the company and its reporters over a critical story and some tweets from its editors. Mother Jones won the case last year, relatively early in the process, but still faced an existential financial crisis because of the enormous legal costs associated with the lawsuit. VanderSloot then announced a   fund to be used for suing Mother Jones and additional members of the “liberal press” in other cases. Even in the Hulk Hogan case, though many people rightly found the story and sex tape offensive and argued it shouldn’t have been published to begin with, a federal judge and an appeals court panel both ruled Gawker was protected by the first amendment before the trial, and they were prevented from having an appeals court rule on the judgment before they filed for bankruptcy.  But we shouldn’t forget that Gawker was not just getting sued over the Hulk Hogan sex tape case. They were the recipient of a   other lawsuits or legal threats involving many stories of an investigative or critical nature that virtually any   law student could tell you are clearly protected by the first amendment.  In the end, even if you think Gawker deserved punishment, media organizations should not face the financial death penalty for a mistake, even a deplorable and egregious one. After all, there is probably one billionaire or another who hates pretty much every news organization in the world worth their salt. If they all decide to go down the path Thiel took, how many publications will be left when they’re done?

157,Texas A&M confirms white nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at university,", Texas AM University has confirmed that Richard Spencer, a prominent figure in the white nationalist “ ” movement, will be allowed to speak at the university, despite protests against his appearance. Spencer hosted a widely criticized event in Washington DC earlier this month. At the event attendees gave Hitler salutes while Spencer himself quoted Nazi propaganda and shouted “Hail Trump”. Spencer was invited to appear at Texas AM by Preston Wiginton, a former student. Wiginton met with university officials on Monday, in a meeting protesters had hoped might lead to the cancellation of Spencer’s appearance. Almost 10, 000 people had signed a petition urging Texas AM to cancel the 6 December event and denounce Spencer’s “  white nationalist rhetoric”. Amy Smith, a spokeswoman for Texas AM, told the Guardian the event would be held as planned, however. Smith said the university had not invited Spencer, but would not cancel the event for reasons of free speech. Texas AM plans to hold its own event at the same time “celebrating the inclusive environment and core values that we hold dear” Smith said. Wiginton, who described himself as “sympathetic to nationalists” told the Guardian he had invited Spencer before the Washington DC event  —   which highlighted the racism and sexism of some in the “ ” movement  —   but had not considered withdrawing the invitation. He said he had invited Spencer “primarily because he’s been in the news quite a bit with the Trump election”. “At American universities the education is so   that it’s more of an indoctrination than a discussion of ideas,” Wiginton said. “I’ve brought other controversial speakers to AM on topics that people don’t want to discuss. Things such as immigration. So I just thought it was an opportunity. ” The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Spencer as “a    version of the white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis”. He is the president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist thinktank, and has proposed a   ban on immigration to the US, to preserve a   America.  More than 9, 800 people signed a petition calling on Texas AM to cancel the Spencer event. Smith, the university’s senior   and chief marketing and communications officer, described Spencer’s views as “reprehensible” but said the event would go ahead. “Our students and our faculty, our staff and our alumni are outraged that this is happening to our campus when no one from our campus desires it,” Smith said. Smith said Wiginton had booked the event space before Texas AM had realised he would use it to host Spencer. When the university discovered Wiginton planned to host a white nationalist event they were unable to cancel it due to free speech laws. Smith said Texas AM planned to review its booking policies. Texas AM will hold an alternative event at the same time as Wiginton’s event, Smith said, which will be a “celebration” of the university’s “core values and diversity”. “We’ll have people address the crowd and it’ll be more of an inclusive event focus [rather] than giving credence to some person and their rhetoric that we find reprehensible,” she said. Wiginton, who attended Texas AM in   said he had invited Spencer as a private citizen. He said he had not yet decided whether the event would be exclusively for university students or would allow members of the public. Spencer is due to speak at Rudder Tower on the university campus. Wiginton said he did not know how many people would attend, but the space would hold 400 people. Wiginton said that he had previously hosted an event with Jared Taylor  —   a white nationalist who also appeared at the “ ” event in Washington DC  —   at Texas AM in October 2012. On that occasion 11 people came to see Taylor speak, Wiginton said, after college lecturers asked students not to attend.",texa univers confirm richard spencer promin figur white nationalist movement allow speak univers despit protest appear spencer host wide critic event washington earlier month event attende gave hitler salut spencer quot nazi propaganda shout hail trump spencer invit appear texa preston wiginton former student wiginton univers offici monday meet protest hope might lead cancel spencer appear almost peopl sign petit urg texa cancel decemb event denounc spencer white nationalist rhetor smith spokeswoman texa told guardian event would held plan howev smith said univers invit spencer would cancel event reason free speech texa plan hold event time celebr inclus environ core valu hold dear smith said wiginton describ sympathet nationalist told guardian invit spencer washington event highlight racism sexism movement consid withdraw invit said invit spencer primarili news quit trump elect american univers educ indoctrin discuss idea wiginton said brought controversi speaker topic peopl want discuss thing immigr thought opportun southern poverti center describ spencer version white supremacist kind profession racist khaki presid nation polici institut white nationalist thinktank propos immigr preserv america more peopl sign petit call texa cancel spencer event smith univers senior chief market commun offic describ spencer view reprehens said event would ahead student faculti staff alumni outrag happen campu campu desir smith said smith said wiginton book event space texa realis would host spencer when univers discov wiginton plan host white nationalist event unabl cancel free speech law smith said texa plan review book polici texa hold altern event time wiginton event smith said celebr univers core valu divers peopl address crowd inclus event focu rather give credenc person rhetor find reprehens said wiginton attend texa said invit spencer privat citizen said decid whether event would exclus univers student would allow member public spencer speak rudder tower univers campu wiginton said know mani peopl would attend space would hold peopl wiginton said previous host event jare taylor white nationalist also appear event washington texa octob occas peopl came taylor speak wiginton said colleg lectur ask student attend
158,Sex in Silicon Valley: are millennials better at free love?,"When I turned 30, in 2011, I envisioned my sexual experience eventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop. I would disembark, find myself    with another human being, and there we would remain in our permanent station in life: the future. I was single and straight. I had not chosen to be single, but love is rare and frequently unreciprocated. Without love, I saw no reason to form a permanent attachment to any particular place. My friends expressed a religious belief that it would arrive for me one day, as if love were something the universe owed to each of us, which no human could escape. I had known love but, having known it, I knew how powerless I was to instigate it or ensure its duration. I knew that it did not arrive for everyone, and as I got older I began to worry it would not arrive for me. On a Monday in April 2012, I stood in line at JFK airport to board a plane to California. I had decided to visit San Francisco because my desires and my reality had diverged beyond the point of reconciliation. I wanted to picture a different future, one aligned with the freedom of my present, and in those years San Francisco was where the future was going to be figured out, or at least it was the city designated for people who still believed in free love. They gave their choices names and they conceived of their actions as social movements. They saw in new technology an opportunity to refashion society, including ideas about sexuality. By 2012, the young people who came to San Francisco were neither dropouts nor misfits. They were children who had grown up eating   cereal, swaddled in polar fleece jackets made from recycled plastic bottles. They had studied abroad, knew their favourite kinds of sashimi and were friends with their parents. Unlike their parents, they commuted to the suburbs and lived in the cities. As they arrived, the cities reshaped to receive their disposable income. In San Francisco, the young people went to coffee shops where the production of espresso was ritualised to resemble a historic   of the hardships of   pioneer life. Nobody smoked cigarettes. They honed their bodies with the aim of either perfect homeostasis or eternal life. They ate red meat only once a month, to time their consumption of iron with the end of their menstrual cycles. They started companies whose names referenced fantasy fiction. They were adults, but they could seem like children. Their sex lives were impossible to fathom, because they seemed never to have lived in darkness. They had grown up observing foreign wars, economic inequality and ecological catastrophe, crises that they earnestly discussed on their digital feeds, but avoided internalising as despair. I’m not saying Elizabeth was all of these things, but she described herself as an optimist. Elizabeth had a membership at a   gym she meditated and practised yoga. She organised   balloon rides and weekend trips. She worked long, punishing hours, but had the energy to stay up all night at weekends, go on cycling excursions or attend silent retreats. A friend of mine had met her at a circus arts class and suggested I meet her. Elizabeth had moved to San Francisco after college. Her boyfriend had moved to the south to go to medical school. No matter how much she loved him, or how much her mother, an infertility specialist, urged her to have children as a young woman, she was not yet ready to start a family. She had a job offer as a consultant at an economics firm. So, in 2010, when she was 22, she moved west and they broke up. Elizabeth had never before lived in a city. She knew the suburbs in Virginia where she had grown up, and the small New England town where she had attended college. She arrived in San Francisco and made friends, some through internet dating. She met Wes one night in late 2010, when he accompanied one of her   to a boardgame party at her house. For their first date, they attended Nerd Night at a local bar. They watched a lecture about the future of teledildonics. On the walk home, they kissed. Then Wes, with the transparency he thought of as mature and fair, gave a speech of   relationship indemnity. He was still getting over his last girlfriend, he said. He did not want to be in a relationship. Elizabeth tried not to roll her eyes  —   it was the first date! They said goodnight and parted ways. Wes had grown up in San Francisco, studied computer science at Harvard and returned west after graduation to work at Google. Somewhere along the upward incline of his precocious youth, he had skipped a grade and was still only 21, tall and handsome. Wes’s previous serious relationship, the one before he met Elizabeth, had ended during his senior year of college. At the time he met Elizabeth, the discovery of how much he liked casual sex was still new to him. Still, Elizabeth and Wes lived near each other. They began meeting once a week for drinks, dates and sleeping over, always with a show of nonchalance. Given the choice, Elizabeth would have wanted a more serious commitment. She was only 23, but she had one reaction to Wes’s lack of interest in their relationship: he was acting like a baby. Fine, she decided. She would also see other people. A few weeks later, she met Brian, a graduate of Stanford who also worked in tech. Soon Elizabeth had two  . Neither relationship had the expectation of exclusivity, or any defined path into the future. She kept the two separate and never saw the men together. They balanced each other, one providing security against the possible failure of the other. One day in May 2011, six months after they met, Elizabeth introduced Wes to psilocybin mushrooms. The trip shifted their relationship. They still did not use the word “love” but they now acknowledged what they referred to as “emotional involvement”. Elizabeth was hired at Google. They took the bus to its Mountain View complex and ate in the cafeteria together. When they went for dinner with Wes’s family, Elizabeth was presented as a friend. Elizabeth did not describe what she was doing  —   having sex with two men on a regular basis over an extended period of time, with the occasional   dalliance besides  —   as polyamory. The word had cultural connotations for her, of swinging married people or creepy old men. Although, like most people her age, she had friends whose partnerships allowed for sex with others, those friends tended to use the term “open relationship” which was somehow less infused with the stigma of intentional weirdness, and did not amount to a proclamation of sexual identity. Still, whatever accidental arrangement she had created, by the end of that year the lack of sexual boundaries was causing Elizabeth no small amount of anxiety. Wes’s crushes from high school were resurfacing. Women on the OkCupid dating site were probably sending him winky emoticons. To allay her growing insecurity, she turned to   and read The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide To Polyamory, Open Relationships  Other Adventures, Sex At Dawn, by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, and Tristan Taormino’s Opening Up. These books convinced Elizabeth that monogamy was a choice, not a given. It began to take on the cast of an unreasonable expectation, best suited to people who disliked experimentation: people not like her. For almost a year, Elizabeth and Wes avoided naming the terms of their relationship. They celebrated the last night of 2011 with friends, and before midnight, because she wanted to say it while still relatively sober, Elizabeth told Wes she loved him. He loved her, too, but he still wanted sexual freedom. She had already decided she wanted it, too. They agreed that they would think of themselves as a couple from now on, instead of two single people who slept together, but they would still not be monogamous. Now they had to figure out how to manage the logistics. Elizabeth compiled a shared Google doc that was to become the foundation of their research  —   a syllabus of recommended reading, places to attend discussion groups and sex parties open to the public. They went to a party at a sex club and had sex surrounded by onlookers. They returned another night, for an   discussion group, but most of the attendees were in their late 30s and were either married and “frisky” or desperate to save their failing marriages. Elizabeth and Wes felt they could draw upon certain ideas of the older polyamorists, but had to do a lot of the thinking on their own. After their research, they began to draw up rules. The first held that, on any given night, one could call the other and say, “Will you please come home?” There was a shared understanding that each of them was the most important person in the other’s life. The second rule was about disclosure: if one of them suspected he or she might sleep with another person, the premonition should be disclosed. They agreed to discuss each other’s crushes. If a sexual encounter happened spontaneously, the event should be disclosed soon afterwards. They would use condoms with their other partners. Despite making rules, they would aim to fail. It was a concept they borrowed from computer security: if an unplanned event occurs, the default is to act first, then worry about formulating responses for the next time. Early in 2012, Brian left the country for three months. In the absence of her second partner, Elizabeth felt an imbalance. Wes was still dating other people and she felt vulnerable. She was also coming to terms with what had been a growing crush on someone else. His name was Chris. He happened to be Wes’s best friend. Wes said he wouldn’t mind if Elizabeth and Chris started to sleep together. Elizabeth, upset, asked how he could possibly care about her and want her to sleep with his best friend. They worked it out. Chris is a tall man with a sweet smile and a shy affect. His parents had met at a commune in Santa Barbara in the early 1980s, so the example he had was one of youthful adventure that would eventually settle into conformity. He met Wes at Google, where they both started working in 2010. Chris and Wes became friends around the time Wes met Elizabeth. Compared with them, Chris had a more introspective personality. He was more careful about taking risks when it came to things such as drugs and relationships. By the end of 2011, the three regularly socialised as a group outside work. Soon after, Chris and Elizabeth would also hang out by themselves. Chris knew that his new friends were in an open relationship, but at first he saw his own role as a mutual confidant, with a much closer relationship to his male counterpart. One night, Chris accompanied Elizabeth and Wes to a queer dance party. They all danced together, dancing that evolved seamlessly to kissing on the dance floor. Chris enjoyed it, but felt a little bit like the third wheel. His friends were on MDMA and he was not. Elizabeth and Wes had planned a foursome with another couple later that night, so Chris ended up going home alone. It became an unspoken understanding that if the three of them went out dancing, they would probably end up kissing together. This was true for a whole group of friends who began to coalesce at this time around Wes and Elizabeth, who began to be sought after as gurus by other couples who had considered opening their relationships. The shared Google doc soon had multiple subscribers. Chris asked Wes whether he really did not mind if he and Elizabeth occasionally slept together. Wes said he didn’t. Then Chris brought up another idea: what about the three of them together, he asked carefully. Or just the two men? Chris described himself as “mostly straight but every once in a while  …    ” Wes happened to be one of the men to whom Chris was attracted. Wes, meanwhile, suspected that he was not at all gay, although in the spirit of the times he was having trouble making such a   declaration. He told Chris he needed to think about it. The two men were affectionate with each other, even kissing hello or goodbye, but Chris was surprisingly troubled by his unreturned desire for Wes. I first met Chris, Elizabeth, and Wes in late May 2012, when their experiment was just a few months old. I was seven years older than Elizabeth and Chris, eight older than Wes. I envied the openness with which they shared their attractions. They did not proceed recklessly. They drew up ethical codes to protect their relationships. Elizabeth and Wes seemed to plunge forward through life without fear. I saw in Chris a little more hesitation. They were not bothered, as I was, by the evidence that nonmonogamous arrangements had been rejected by the last generation of straight people who had tried them. I looked at the experiments of the 60s and 70s, and felt they had taught us that communes and other alternative arrangements that celebrated sexual freedom generally ended in jealousy and hurt feelings. We obedient children of the 80s and 90s saw the failures of the counterculture, and held ourselves in thrall to drug laws, health insurance, student loan payments, internships, condoms, skin protection factors, antidepressants, designated smoking areas, politically correct language, child safety locks, gym memberships, cancer screenings and career advancement. We had a nuanced understanding of risk. When it came to sex, I thought we had it much better than previous generations. We knew better than to move into rural communes or force one’s wife to sleep with another man to overcome her cultural programming. We had more access to birth control, and knew more about our bodies. We had a vast selection of vibrators sold in   retail environments. We had rape crisis centres, legal abortion and    emergency contraception. What my married parents imparted as the lessons from the 60s was that it was fine to have as much casual (“safe”) sex as we wanted as   teenagers and young adults, and fine secretly to “experiment” with the more benign and least addictive drugs (although no teacher or relative ever openly recommended it) but eventually we would grow up and settle into the nuclear families we saw on television. Some of us would be gay and that would be fine. Many of these families would fall apart, but we did not consider divorce a structural failure of an institution, but a set of personal problems. Among my mostly secular group of friends, the ceremonies of marriage and death were the only ritual sacraments left. I believed in the mystique of commitment. Could I think of myself as an adult if I never married? Would my married friends become distant and remote? Elizabeth, Wes and Chris believed there were still primary choices to make about sexuality. I wasn’t the only one who kept thinking about the warnings of people who had observed the 60s and felt hesitation. There was a phrase being thrown around the Bay Area only  : “responsible hedonism”. In the spring of 2012, Elizabeth would spend most nights with Wes and the occasional night with Chris or someone else. The three friends would see each other at work, too. When their relationships evolved, the shifts tended to happen not in slow increments, but with sudden tectonic upheavals, usually during    retreats that served as emotional crucibles. Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship had acquired an acceleration, a momentum based on mutual daring. In the way that some couples might spend their energy systematically eating at new restaurants, Elizabeth and Wes went to sex parties. Elizabeth attended two porn shoots, one of them with Wes, the other with a woman who had become another   sexual partner. In June 2013, Wes left Google to start his own company. Between ending one job and beginning the other, he travelled around Europe. Elizabeth met him in Amsterdam, where they hired a prostitute. In May 2013, Elizabeth took a work trip to Tokyo. Chris decided to go with her and play “house husband”. For the first time, they honestly discussed Chris’s understanding of Wes, of how, in Chris’s hopes and expectations, he had fallen in love  —   “filled in the dots with his own lines” as Elizabeth put it. She left the conversation feeling they finally understood their differences, but also felt Chris’s romantic attraction to her break. As untraditional as Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship was, it had started to look as if it was heading toward the traditional happy ending. They discussed moving in together, and finally did so in late 2013. The decision carried less weight with the knowledge that, at least a few times a month, one of them would be spending the night at someone else’s place. The lingering question for both was what would happen should one of them fall in love with someone else. They even discussed this likelihood with an older married couple, a couple in their late 30s who had been married for years. The man told them a story of how in the course of their open marriage, his wife had truly fallen for another person. He called it a “crisis episode”. They decided together that they were what they called “life journey partners”  —   a designation that sounded very hokey, but that was meant to indicate, Wes said, that “there’s being in love, and there’s being in love and wanting to spend the rest of your life with someone”. There would be times when a person had to compromise. In August 2014, Elizabeth and Wes got engaged at the Burning Man festival. In August 2015, I attended their wedding in Black Rock City. To the tune of Somewhere Over The Rainbow played on an electric piano, Wes and Elizabeth, he in a white,   shirt and black trousers, she in a white dress, both with colourful face paint around their eyes, processed to an altar decorated with pink fabric flowers and tasselled fringe. Relatives delivered loving statements. Wes’s godfather recited a Druid prayer. We lit sparklers and held them skyward as the sun set, forming a ring of light. The drone of a didgeridoo obscured the couple’s quiet murmuring. “By the power invested in me by the internet, you are now married,” said the officiant, Wes’s uncle. “You can kiss each other and other people. ” Chris and Elizabeth threw their first sex party in the fall of 2012. In early 2015, I went to the fourth iteration, Thunderwear IV, in a rented loft. A    portrait of Elizabeth lifting one of her legs up over her head in a full split and penetrating herself with a dildo hung over the room. She had installed a stripper pole. The invitation had laid out the party’s rules in a charter, to which every invitee had to agree: 1 Useful mantra: low expectations, high possibilities. 2 Consent is required. And sexy. If you wanna do something, ask first. Bonus points for enthusiastic consent. 3 This is a party. Parties are fun! You don’t have to do anything you don’t wanna do. If you don’t wanna, say “no thanks”. 4 This is a party. Have fun! White ribbon means: ask to feed me (remember, you can say no). Red ribbon means: ask me for a kiss (on the cheek  …     at first, at least). 5 Relationship conversation with your partner recommended before you start partying. There was one final rule: no glitter, at the request of the venue. The party started calmly, with drinking and talking. I stood and talked with one of the two other people over 30. Elizabeth, ever organised, told me she had taken out liability insurance for the stripper pole. The friends had arranged to begin the evening with an amateur burlesque show. We watched a slightly botched acrobatic routine to Rihanna’s song Jump. The next woman performed a   striptease that concluded with her taping a pair of red cups to her breasts, filling them with Malibu, orange juice and coconut milk, and letting people drink from them with straws. Then, to Rihanna’s Birthday Cake, came a striptease that ended with the performer smearing herself all over with cake. After the show, I walked into the massive   bathroom with its Jacuzzi and had a conversation with a couple about the dream of one day living in a backyard casita in Oakland with a composting toilet. I wandered back to the loft, where couples and threesomes had begun to pair off on couches. Nearby was a wheel of fortune that could be spun for instructions. After several conversations that felt like job interviews, I ended up taking turns spinning the wheel with a man. I did so with a slightly exhausted determination to get the show on the road. He was a bit younger. We spun the wheel, awkwardly obeying instructions to feed each other strawberries and kiss. Then we went into the second room to do  . I had never done a  . My new friend explained how it worked: screw a small canister of nitrous oxide on to a     maker. Exhale deeply, then inhale while depressing the handle of the machine, filling your lungs with nitrous oxide instead of oxygen. This produces a   or   high. Deprived of oxygen, the mind dissolves physical sensation becomes acute, a goofy giddiness sets in.   are good for a sex party, because they do not impair sexual function and can heighten physical sensation, although I was advised not to do too many. On my first   the man I had met lightly touched my arm, the feeling of his hands producing warmth and electricity while my vision broke into geometric patterns. During his turn, he asked that I kiss him. We made out for a while, doing the occasional  . I felt airy and happy. We stood up with our hands against the wall and took turns smacking each other with a riding crop. Around us, groups of people lay together on beds and couches, or stood making out in corners. On a couch, a man lay across the laps of his friends, who formed a spanking train. I sat with Elizabeth and took a   after which she massaged my head while a man lightly shocked me with an electrified wand. The   was at the apartment of one of Elizabeth’s partners, a man with whom she had exchanged   . I had overheard a conversation between her and Wes before she left, where she had asked Wes if he would let her go on her own. It was a conversation that was difficult to listen to. I believed Wes when he cheerfully assented, but I also knew my own feelings would have been hurt. Chris was there, too, with his now steady girlfriend. Elizabeth had slyly slipped me a condom, but I didn’t have sex. My then boyfriend in New York had not wanted me to attend the party at all. I was still thinking of myself as just a visitor, or rather neither here nor there, someone undertaking an abstract inquiry, but not yet with true intention. I regretted having been shy in my making out earlier at the sex party, that I had spent the night with one person instead of joining the cuddle puddle coalesced on the   bed opposite. I wished I had other chances for this degree of experimentation, and wondered what it would feel like to be not a visitor to this scene, but a part of it. It had been easier for me to relax, because most of the people in the room had been strangers. Now I sat in a penthouse with a group of sleepy partygoers. We chatted and looked at the view. In the background was the sound of   of orgasms, of water falling from a shower into a porcelain tub. • This is an edited extract from Future Sex, by Emily Witt, published next month by Faber  Faber at £16. 99.

159,Carey Mulligan joins London protest against bombardment of Aleppo,"Hundreds of people including the actor Carey Mulligan have protested in central London to call for the government to end the bloodshed in Syria. Mulligan joined the demonstration just opposite the gates to Downing Street, where teddy bears were later laid in a poignant message from campaigners about the human cost of the   conflict. Mulligan said Britain could lead the way in efforts to address the plight of children caught up in the bitter war. The crowd included children wearing “Save Aleppo”   and other people carrying placards urging a “  zone now” while some flew Syrian flags. A small light   teddy bear belonging to Mulligan’s young daughter Evelyn was among the pile. “Since having my daughter it just drives home even more how unimaginable it would be for my daughter to be in any of these situations and to have to deal with any of this,” she said. “It just really drives me to speak out and do more if I can. ” The actor told the crowd: “I’m safe in the knowledge that when I put Evie down to bed she is safe. The parents in Aleppo aren’t. They don’t know what the night will bring. ” Mulligan, who is an ambassador for War Child, described the demonstration as an opportunity to “stand up and say that we need to do something real”. She has previously spoken out to say the inaction in Calais, where many unaccompanied refugee children became stranded in the refugee camp, made her ashamed to be British.  Mulligan said the arrival of young refugees in Croydon this week made her feel “very proud to be British in this regard  —   we have made a strong stance”. A letter has been delivered to Number 10 demanding Theresa May take action to help end the violence. It comes after the prime minister insisted on Friday that the EU must keep “all options” open if Russia continued to commit atrocities in the conflict zone. Campaigners said the day of action was a rebuttal to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who called for protests outside the Russian embassy, because they feel the British government needs to play a stronger role. Labour MP Alison McGovern’s voice broke with emotion as she remembered her friend the late Jo Cox MP’s work in helping civilians in Syria. “It shouldn’t be me who is speaking here today, it should be my friend Jo Cox, but because she isn’t here, we have to be here,” she told the rally. “Fifty thousand children have been killed in Syria since 2011, and millions have fled their homes. “There are 100, 000 children trapped right now in Aleppo. ” Other organisations involved in the campaign include Amnesty International UK, Avaaz and Christian Aid.  Bert Wander, Avaaz campaign director, said: “The bloodbath in Aleppo has gone on long enough, and Theresa May must listen to the people on the streets and support a   zone to stop the slaughter. “How many schools, hospitals and families must be bombed before Syria becomes a priority? If the prime minister fails to act, history will judge her harshly. ” Aleppo was calm on Saturday, the third day of a ceasefire brokered by Russia, but medical evacuations and aid deliveries have yet to take place, according to a monitoring group. No Syrian or Russian air strikes on the eastern   side of Aleppo have been reported since Russia began the pause in hostilities on Thursday, the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. But rebels have said they cannot accept the ceasefire, which they say does nothing to alleviate the suffering of those who choose to remain in Aleppo, and believe it is part of a government policy to purge cities of political opponents. The Syrian army and Russia have called on residents and rebels in besieged eastern Aleppo to leave through designated corridors under a promise of safe travel, but very few rebels or civilians appear to have done so.  Meanwhile, Russian warships potentially bringing supplies to the bombing campaign against Aleppo passed through the Channel on Friday. The Russian ships were likely to pass from the Channel towards Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean, heading for the Syrian coast, according to a senior Nato diplomat. The source told Reuters that the vessels were carrying fighter bombers expected to join the attack on the besieged city.",hundr peopl includ actor carey mulligan protest central london call govern bloodsh syria mulligan join demonstr opposit gate down street teddi bear later laid poignant messag campaign human cost conflict mulligan said britain could lead effort address plight children caught bitter crowd includ children wear save aleppo peopl carri placard urg zone flew syrian flag small light teddi bear belong mulligan young daughter evelyn among pile sinc daughter drive home even unimagin would daughter situat deal said realli drive speak actor told crowd safe knowledg evi safe parent aleppo they know night bring mulligan ambassador child describ demonstr opportun stand need someth real previous spoken inact calai mani unaccompani refuge children becam strand refuge camp made asham british mulligan said arriv young refuge croydon week made feel proud british regard made strong stanc letter deliv number demand theresa take action help violenc come prime minist insist friday must keep option open russia continu commit atroc conflict zone campaign said action rebutt bori johnson foreign secretari call protest outsid russian embassi feel british govern need play stronger role labour alison mcgovern voic broke emot rememb friend late work help civilian syria speak today friend told ralli fifti thousand children kill syria sinc million fled home there children trap right aleppo other organis involv campaign includ amnesti intern avaaz christian bert wander avaaz campaign director said bloodbath aleppo gone long enough theresa must listen peopl street support zone stop slaughter mani school hospit famili must bomb syria becom prioriti prime minist fail histori judg harshli aleppo calm saturday third ceasefir broker russia medic evacu deliveri take place accord monitor group syrian russian strike eastern side aleppo report sinc russia began paus hostil thursday syrian observatori human right said rebel said cannot accept ceasefir noth allevi suffer choos remain aleppo believ part govern polici purg citi polit oppon syrian armi russia call resid rebel besieg eastern aleppo leav design corridor promis safe travel rebel civilian appear done meanwhil russian warship potenti bring suppli bomb campaign aleppo pass channel friday russian ship like pass channel toward gibraltar mediterranean head syrian coast accord senior nato diplomat sourc told reuter vessel carri fighter bomber expect join attack besieg citi
160,Putin clarifies Trump comment and says America is the world’s ’only superpower’,"Vladimir Putin downplayed past comments about Donald Trump and spoke about the presidential election on Friday, adding that he accepted the US is probably the world’s sole superpower. “America is a great power. Today, probably, the only superpower. We accept that,” the Russian president said at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We want to and are ready to work with the United States. ” Alluding to   sanctions on Russia in response to its military actions in Ukraine, he continued: “The world needs such strong nations, like the US. And we need them. But we don’t need them constantly getting mixed up in our affairs, instructing us how to live, preventing Europe from building a relationship with us. ” Asked about the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Putin again described Trump as a “flamboyant” or “colorful” man, using a Russian word  —   “яркий”  —   that can be translated with ambiguous connotations, from gaudy to striking to dazzling. “You see, it’s like I said,” Putin told his questioner. “Trump’s a colorful person. And well, isn’t he colorful? Colorful. I didn’t make any other kind of characterization about him. “But here’s where I will pay close attention, and where I exactly welcome and where on the contrary I don’t see anything bad: Mr Trump has declared that he’s ready for the full restoration of   relations. Is there anything bad there? We all welcome this, don’t you?” In December, months before Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Putin called him “a colorful person, talented, without any doubt” and said: “It’s not our business to decide his merits, that’s for US voters, but he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race. ” Trump has for months misinterpreted Putin’s comments as “a great honor” and clear praise, rather than consider the various meanings of the word.  “When people call you brilliant, it’s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,” he told MSNBC shortly after Putin’s original comments.  In May Trump falsely described the comments as a compliment of his intelligence. “They want me to disavow Putin,” he said. “Putin of Russia said Trump is a genius. ”  Trump has proposed   cooperation regarding Syria,   and trade deals, and defended Putin’s record on eliminating a free press. The Kremlin and its allies have over 15 years dismantled independent news organizations, and the 2006 murder of investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya has also been linked by activists to Putin’s Kremlin. Trump told ABC in December: “it’s never been proven that he killed anybody. ” The businessman’s top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, was an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych, a   Ukrainian politician who was fled to Russia after a 2014 revolution ousted him from office. Putin also spoke carefully on Friday about the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying he did not work much with her directly when she was secretary of state.  “She probably has her own view of   relations,” he said. But he praised her husband, former president Bill Clinton, saying: “We had a very nice relationship. “I can even say that I’m grateful to him for several moments, when I was making my entrance into world politics. On several occasions he showed signs of attention, respect to me personally and to Russia. ” The diplomatic remarks belie the cold and increasingly hostile relations between Clinton and Putin toward the end of her time in the Obama administration. In 2011, when he was prime minister of Russia and facing massive street protests, Putin accused the then secretary of state of fomenting dissent. Clinton’s state department, he said, had sent a “signal” and “support” to opposition leaders. On Friday Putin insisted Russia does not interfere in other nation’s affairs, and that the Kremlin would be glad to work with any leader elected abroad.  “We need to bring back trust to   relations and restore the level of cooperation,” he said.",vladimir putin downplay past comment donald trump spoke presidenti elect friday ad accept probabl world sole superpow america great power today probabl superpow accept russian presid said petersburg intern econom forum want readi work unit state allud sanction russia respons militari action ukrain continu world need strong nation like need need constantli get mix affair instruct live prevent europ build relationship ask presumpt republican nomine presid putin describ trump flamboy color use russian word translat ambigu connot gaudi strike dazzl like said putin told question trump color person well color color make kind character close attent exactli welcom contrari anyth trump declar readi full restor relat anyth welcom decemb month trump clinch republican nomin putin call color person talent without doubt said busi decid merit voter absolut leader presidenti race trump month misinterpret putin comment great honor clear prais rather consid variou mean word when peopl call brilliant alway good especi person head russia told msnbc shortli putin origin comment trump fals describ comment compliment intellig they want disavow putin said putin russia said trump geniu trump propos cooper regard syria trade deal defend putin record elimin free press kremlin alli year dismantl independ news organ murder investig report anna politkovskaya also link activist putin kremlin trump told decemb never proven kill anybodi businessman campaign aid paul manafort advis viktor yanukovych ukrainian politician fled russia revolut oust offic putin also spoke care friday presumpt democrat nomine hillari clinton say work much directli secretari state probabl view relat said prais husband former presid bill clinton say nice relationship even grate sever moment make entranc world polit sever occas show sign attent respect person russia diplomat remark beli cold increasingli hostil relat clinton putin toward time obama administr prime minist russia face massiv street protest putin accus secretari state foment dissent clinton state depart said sent signal support opposit leader friday putin insist russia interfer nation affair kremlin would glad work leader elect abroad need bring back trust relat restor level cooper said
161,Rain swamps China regions breaching dykes and causing landslides,"China has often recently been plagued by heavy rain, and the past week has been no exception. Rainfall of between 100mm and 200mm was recorded last weekend, with Hunan province worst affected. The downpours triggered flooding and landslides, which destroyed houses and blocked rail lines and roads. As well as the seasonal heavy rain, the effects of Typhoon Nepartak had been felt in neighbouring provinces in the previous week. Several parts of the US have had stormy weather over the past few days. A large thunderstorm passed over Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday afternoon and produced a spectacular microburst. Microbursts are sudden, localised, downdraughts of cool air from the underneath of a storm they can produce   but powerful gusts of wind as the descending air reaches the ground and spreads out away from the storm.  The gusts in this case were strong enough to knock down trees, and the accompanying heavy rain caused localised flooding. The Phoenix Sky Harbor airport was temporarily closed due to winds and lightning risk.  At the other end of the country,   thunderstorms were also reported to have caused damage at Oneida Lake, New York, and Madison, New Hampshire.  On Tuesday, in South Dakota and further north, in Alberta, Canada, there were also active thunderstorms which produced hail stones up to the size of baseballs. Northern New Zealand has been battered by strong winds over the past couple of days, with winds gusting to 90mph in places on Tuesday. Gusts over 60mph were recorded on Auckland Harbour Bridge, and a tornado was reported in the Waikato region.",china often recent plagu heavi rain past week except rainfal record last weekend hunan provinc worst affect downpour trigger flood landslid destroy hous block rail line road well season heavi rain effect typhoon nepartak felt neighbour provinc previou week sever part stormi weather past day larg thunderstorm pass phoenix arizona monday afternoon produc spectacular microburst microburst sudden localis downdraught cool underneath storm produc power gust wind descend reach ground spread away storm gust case strong enough knock tree accompani heavi rain caus localis flood phoenix harbor airport temporarili close wind lightn risk countri thunderstorm also report caus damag oneida lake york madison hampshir tuesday south dakota north alberta canada also activ thunderstorm produc hail stone size basebal northern zealand batter strong wind past coupl day wind gust place tuesday gust record auckland harbour bridg tornado report waikato region
162,Trump said he’d be the president of all Americans. He’s already failing,"In the wee morning hours following the election, in the   ballroom of the Hilton Hotel, Donald Trump memorably proclaimed he would be the “president for all Americans”. It was a remarkable claim for a man who’d run a campaign mired in bigotry and xenophobia.  The following week President Obama declared he was certain Trump was “sincere” in his promise to be every American’s president, and over the weekend, in his final press conference of the year, the president was similarly conciliatory. World leaders have likewise made   gestures. Shortly after the election, the UN secretary general, Ban   predicted Trump would change his views on climate, and a key dignitary at a major UN climate meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, made a similar argument.  “We have for many months listened to the candidate Trump. Today we have to deal with the President Trump,” Morocco’s minister of the environment, Hakima El Haité, told me days after the election. “Those are two personalities. ” Already such optimism looks unwarranted. Since becoming   Trump has called for the mass deportation of immigrants. He’s also selected a cabinet that is mostly white, mostly male, and mostly business leaders  —   in other words, a cabinet that looks a whole lot like him. That’s not populism it’s cronyism. And it’s proliferating, even before inauguration day. After winning over   workers in middle America with promises to restore their slipping quality of life, for instance, he chose a CEO to head his labor department. His nominee has been outspoken in his opposition to minimum wage increases. And Trump wants a man who was once denied a federal judgeship over accusations of racism to head the justice department.  But perhaps the best barometer thus far of whether Trump will really be everyone’s president is his approach to climate change, which has emerged as an area of overwhelming concern among Americans, and which, in the decades ahead, will transform the fiscal and political landscape across the world. It may not rank near the top of people’s priorities list  —   it seldom does. But climate, and in particular renewable energy, has nevertheless emerged as a place where partisan rancor looks increasingly outdated.  Concern about climate change is already at an   high, according to Gallup’s most recent polling, with 64% of respondents say they worry “a great deal” or a “fair amount” about global warming. Nearly   of Americans now say humans are responsible, and while the percentage of people who think climate will pose a serious threat in their lifetime has ebbed slightly, that number is still well over half the population. But forget being the president for all Americans Trump is not even accurately representing his own party’s views. A majority of Republicans now believe the world’s climate is changing and that humans play some role in that, according to a recent survey by Republican pollsters. Mitt Romney, the party’s most recent nominee before Trump, has gone even further by saying we must do something about it. And at least some of the incredulity expressed over Trump’s recent cabinet picks has come from inside his own party  —   including from a former Republican administrator of the EPA. The faint hope engendered by an early meeting with Al Gore, and Trump’s remarks that he was keeping an “open mind” about international climate accords, was unceremoniously quashed last week as he proceeded to roll out what looks to be the most   administration in recent memory. And even before the cabinet announcements came out, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley was proclaiming Trump will do away with a wind energy tax credit, “over my dead body”. Then there’s the fact that Trump didn’t even win the majority of votes in America. After campaigning on the idea that the American electoral system is rigged, back when he thought it was rigged in Hillary Clinton’s favor, he’s now espousing exactly the opposite: at a rally in Alabama on Saturday, he called the electoral college “genius”. What changed, of course, was who the system benefited. Now that it’s clear the outdated system benefits him, he’s all for it. The same is true of his claims Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the presidential election. Two years ago Trump said Russian hacking was a “big problem”. But now it looks to have benefited him, he calls claims Russia played any role in the election “ridiculous”. Foreign dignitaries like Haité shouldn’t hold their breath, particularly where international cooperation is concerned. Trump isn’t going to be the president of all Americans. He’s going to be the president for rich white men like him.",morn hour follow elect ballroom hilton hotel donald trump memor proclaim would presid american remark claim campaign mire bigotri xenophobia follow week presid obama declar certain trump sincer promis everi american presid weekend final press confer year presid similarli conciliatori world leader likewis made gestur shortli elect secretari gener predict trump would chang view climat dignitari major climat meet marrakech morocco made similar argument mani month listen candid trump today deal presid trump morocco minist environ hakima hait told day elect those person alreadi optim look unwarr sinc becom trump call mass deport immigr also select cabinet mostli white mostli male mostli busi leader word cabinet look whole like that popul cronyism prolifer even inaugur after win worker middl america promis restor slip qualiti life instanc chose head labor depart nomine outspoken opposit minimum wage increas trump want deni feder judgeship accus racism head justic depart perhap best baromet thu whether trump realli everyon presid approach climat chang emerg area overwhelm concern among american decad ahead transform fiscal polit landscap across world rank near peopl prioriti list seldom climat particular renew energi nevertheless emerg place partisan rancor look increasingli outdat concern climat chang alreadi high accord gallup recent poll respond worri great deal fair amount global warm nearli american human respons percentag peopl think climat pose seriou threat lifetim eb slightli number still well half popul forget presid american trump even accur repres parti view major republican believ world climat chang human play role accord recent survey republican pollster mitt romney parti recent nomine trump gone even say must someth least incredul express trump recent cabinet pick come insid parti includ former republican administr faint hope engend earli meet gore trump remark keep open mind intern climat accord unceremoni quash last week proceed roll look administr recent memori even cabinet announc came iowa republican chuck grassley proclaim trump away wind energi credit dead bodi then fact trump even major vote america after campaign idea american elector system rig back thought rig hillari clinton favor espous exactli opposit ralli alabama saturday call elector colleg geniu what chang cours system benefit clear outdat system benefit true claim russian hacker influenc outcom presidenti elect year trump said russian hack problem look benefit call claim russia play role elect ridicul foreign dignitari like hait hold breath particularli intern cooper concern trump go presid american go presid rich white like
163,’It was like a monster’: Hurricane Matthew leaves Haiti in crisis,"Hurricane Matthew arrived thrashing at the door of Rosemika’s house in    at 6am on Tuesday.  “It happened so quickly and suddenly,” the    told aid workers. “I heard my neighbour screaming: ‘Water! Water everywhere!’ It had completely surrounded us. ”  Rosemika and her brothers and sisters ran, terrified, to the sanctuary of the hills. Like some of her friends in Haiti’s Ouest department, they lost their home to the fury of the wind and the rain. The water “was like a monster, hitting everything violently,” she said. Three days after the hurricane tore through the poorest country in the western hemisphere, taking with it thousands of homes, the scale of the destruction is only just beginning to emerge. Communications in the   departments of Grand’Anse and Sud are still badly affected and the loss of a bridge connecting the capital,    to the   is frustrating the relief effort. There were fears by Friday afternoon that almost 600 people had been killed, but it will take days before a definitive toll can be established. A Reuters tally of deaths reported by local civil protection officials suggested 842 people had died, but that figure has not been confirmed by the government or the civil protection agency. The government put the figure at nearly 300 and Radio Television Caraibes 264. Hervé Fourcand, a senator for Sud department, said more than 300 people had died in the region alone. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that more than a million Haitians have been affected, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. It has launched a £5. 8m appeal to help provide medical relief, shelter, water and sanitation over the next year. The devastation has prompted the authorities to postpone the presidential election scheduled for Sunday as they try to gauge the scale of the country’s worst natural disaster since a devastating earthquake struck the country in January 2010. Many victims were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit, bringing winds of 145mph. Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in the   of the country, a region of Caribbean white sand beaches and rivers backed by hills.   Jeune, an official with the civil protection agency working in the mountains on the outskirts of the devastated city of Jérémie in Grand’Anse department, said his team had found 82 bodies that had not been recorded by authorities in the capital because of patchy communications. Most appeared to have been killed by debris. “We don’t have any contact with    yet and there are places we still haven’t reached,” Jeune told the Associated Press as he and his colleagues searched the area. The Haitian government, UN agencies and NGOs are now trying to get food, water and temporary shelters to those who have been stranded for three days already. “We are only now beginning to see the full scale of the damage as we begin to reach more of the communities that have been cut off,” said Marie Therese Frederique Jean Pierre, Plan International’s country director in Haiti.  “Roads and bridges were severely damaged by the hurricane, so there are still some rural areas that we have been unable to reach. ” Prospery Raymond, Christian Aid’s Haiti director, said the charity’s efforts to get vital supplies out of    were being hindered by traffic jams at river crossings. He also said there was a serious shortage of food in the   southern port town of Les Cayes. “People are trying to cope together,” he said. “After the earthquake, some people don’t want to be in camps. They’re living in their gardens even if there’s nothing left and trying to grab protein from breadfruit. But for how long?” Christian Aid has launched an appeal to help see people through the next few months by giving them water, food and cash, but Raymond said that money would also be needed to rebuild houses and buy seeds and livestock for farmers who had lost everything. One of the biggest concerns is that Hurricane Matthew could provoke a surge in the cholera epidemic that has killed almost 10, 000 Haitians since it was unwittingly introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers after the 2010 earthquake. To that end, NGOs and others are distributing soap, chlorine tablets and hygiene kits to the most vulnerable areas. “Diarrhoea and cholera are a looming threat with flooding causing sewage to flow into the streets,” said Yolette Etienne, ActionAid’s country director. “Continued rain and flooding could cause   disease to spread further. ” The immediate priority will be containing the humanitarian crisis, but work is already under way to try to plan for the coming months and years. Yvonne Helle, the UN Development Programme’s Haiti director, said people in Grand’Anse had lost everything   their houses, their fruit trees and their fields. With 80% of the crops in the south thought to have been washed out, its people had “basically lost their entire livelihoods and their food source”.  “It’s devastating,” she said, adding that the residents of the extremely poor rural area had no backup or safety net besides the remittances they receive from relatives overseas. “Of course we need to focus on the humanitarian and keep everybody alive,” she said. “But we also want to get people back to their homes as soon as possible to rebuild, replant and pick up their lives. ”",hurrican matthew arriv thrash door rosemika hous tuesday happen quickli suddenli told worker heard neighbour scream water water everywher complet surround rosemika brother sister terrifi sanctuari hill like friend haiti ouest depart lost home furi wind rain water like monster hit everyth violent said three day hurrican tore poorest countri western hemispher take thousand home scale destruct begin emerg commun depart grand ans still badli affect loss bridg connect capit frustrat relief effort there fear friday afternoon almost peopl kill take day definit toll establish reuter talli death report local civil protect offici suggest peopl die figur confirm govern civil protect agenc govern figur nearli radio televis caraib herv fourcand senat depart said peopl die region alon intern feder cross crescent societi estim million haitian affect hundr thousand peopl urgent need humanitarian assist launch appeal help provid medic relief shelter water sanit next year devast prompt author postpon presidenti elect schedul sunday gaug scale countri worst natur disast sinc devast earthquak struck countri januari mani victim kill fall tree fli debri swollen river matthew bring wind most fatal town fish villag around western tiburon peninsula countri region caribbean white sand beach river back hill jeun offici civil protect agenc work mountain outskirt devast citi grand ans depart said team found bodi record author capit patchi commun most appear kill debri contact place still reach jeun told associ press colleagu search area haitian govern agenc ngo tri food water temporari shelter strand three day alreadi begin full scale damag begin reach commun said mari theres frederiqu jean pierr plan intern countri director haiti road bridg sever damag hurrican still rural area unabl reach prosperi raymond christian haiti director said chariti effort vital suppli hinder traffic jam river cross also said seriou shortag food southern port town cay peopl tri cope togeth said after earthquak peopl want camp they live garden even noth left tri grab protein breadfruit long christian launch appeal help peopl next month give water food cash raymond said money would also need rebuild hous seed livestock farmer lost everyth biggest concern hurrican matthew could provok surg cholera epidem kill almost haitian sinc unwittingli introduc countri peacekeep earthquak ngo other distribut soap chlorin tablet hygien kit vulner area diarrhoea cholera loom threat flood caus sewag flow street said yolett etienn actionaid countri director continu rain flood could caus diseas spread immedi prioriti contain humanitarian crisi work alreadi plan come month year yvonn hell develop programm haiti director said peopl grand ans lost everyth hous fruit tree field with crop south thought wash peopl basic lost entir livelihood food sourc devast said ad resid extrem poor rural area backup safeti besid remitt receiv rel oversea cours need focu humanitarian keep everybodi aliv said also want peopl back home soon possibl rebuild replant pick live
164,"Hillary Clinton blames Comey letters for election defeat, reports say","Hillary Clinton has reportedly blamed two letters to Congress by FBI director James Comey for her defeat by Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Politico was first to report that Clinton made the comments on Saturday, in a call with donors who gave more than $100, 000 to her campaign. Clinton’s presidential run ended with a narrow victory in the popular vote but defeat  —   by 290 votes to 228, with Michigan and New Hampshire yet to declare  —   in the electoral college that decides the presidency.  An individual who was on the donors’ call, Politico reported, claimed Clinton said the first letter prompted a fall in favourable polling but there was a rebound before the second letter “awakened Donald Trump’s voters”. The New York Times quoted a donor as saying Clinton said: “There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful   …     our analysis is that Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum. ” The comments, which were similar to reported remarks by other campaign sources, contrasted with anger from Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC). He told the Guardian on Saturday it was Clinton’s neglect of Latino voters that handed the presidency to Trump. Comey made headlines on 28 October with his first letter, 11 days before the vote. In the letter, he told members of Congress that new emails had been discovered that could be relevant to a completed investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The original investigation had ended in July with no charge against Clinton, who Comey said had been “extremely careless” in her conduct, but not to the extent of criminal or intentional wrongdoing. The new emails were discovered, it was reported, on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, during an investigation into Weiner for for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a minor. Republicans responded with bafflement at Comey’s break with policy and decades of precedent, and furious senior Democrats suggested the FBI director may have violated the Hatch Act, a federal statute that bars political activity by senior officials. Comey’s second letter was sent last Sunday, two days before the election. In it, he said a review of the newly discovered emails had been completed, and that it found no evidence to merit reopening the investigation of Clinton.  Republicans, including Trump, responded angrily, alleging that the review could not have been completed correctly in so short a time. Reports said 650, 000 emails were in question, although that number was not officially confirmed. Saturday’s reported remarks mirrored comments, previously reported by Politico, in an email from Navin Nayak, Clinton’s head of opinion research. “We believe that we lost this election in the last week,” the magazine reported Nayak as writing on Thursday. “Comey’s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among   white voters  —   particularly in the suburbs.  “We also think Comey’s [second] letter, which was intended to absolve [Secretary] Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump’s turnout. ” Clinton did not speak on election night, instead delivering a concession speech at a hotel in New York on Wednesday. In excerpts from an interview to be broadcast by CBS on Sunday, Trump discussed the call he took from his Democratic opponent in the small hours of that morning. “So Hillary called and it was a lovely call,” he said, adding: “She couldn’t have been nicer. She just said, ‘Congratulations, Donald, well done.’ And I said, ‘I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor. ’” Politico’s source said Clinton seemed “sad but hopeful” on the donors call, as she discussed the importance to Democrats of political engagement in the future.  In a speech to the   on Thursday, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren attributed Clinton’s defeat to a failed economic message, saying: “The final results may have divided us but the entire electorate embraced deep, fundamental reform of our economic system and our political system. ” Palomarez, head of an organisation which represents 4. 2m   businesses, blamed Clinton’s failure on a lack of engagement with Latino voters.  He told the Guardian: “We thought this election cycle would be different. Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was advised once again by Beltway advisers who knew it all, had the models and the projections, but who called it wrong. ”",hillari clinton reportedli blame letter congress director jame comey defeat donald trump presidenti elect politico first report clinton made comment saturday call donor gave campaign clinton presidenti end narrow victori popular vote defeat vote michigan hampshir declar elector colleg decid presid individu donor call politico report claim clinton said first letter prompt fall favour poll rebound second letter awaken donald trump voter york time quot donor say clinton said there lot reason elect like success analysi comey letter rais doubt groundless baseless proven stop momentum comment similar report remark campaign sourc contrast anger javier palomarez presid chief execut hispan chamber commerc ushcc told guardian saturday clinton neglect latino voter hand presid trump comey made headlin octob first letter day vote letter told member congress email discov could relev complet investig clinton privat email server secretari state origin investig end juli charg clinton comey said extrem careless conduct extent crimin intent wrongdo email discov report devic belong anthoni weiner estrang husband clinton aid huma abedin investig weiner allegedli exchang lewd messag minor republican respond bafflement comey break polici decad preced furiou senior democrat suggest director violat hatch feder statut bar polit activ senior offici comey second letter sent last sunday day elect said review newli discov email complet found evid merit reopen investig clinton republican includ trump respond angrili alleg review could complet correctli short time report said email question although number offici confirm saturday report remark mirror comment previous report politico email navin nayak clinton head opinion research believ lost elect last week magazin report nayak write thursday comey letter last day elect help depress turnout also drove away critic support among white voter particularli suburb also think comey second letter intend absolv secretari clinton actual help bolster trump turnout clinton speak elect night instead deliv concess speech hotel york wednesday excerpt interview broadcast sunday trump discuss call took democrat oppon small hour morn hillari call love call said ad nicer said congratul donald well done said want thank much great competitor politico sourc said clinton seem hope donor call discuss import democrat polit engag futur speech thursday massachusett senat elizabeth warren attribut clinton defeat fail econom messag say final result divid entir elector embrac deep fundament reform econom system polit system palomarez head organis repres busi blame clinton failur lack engag latino voter told guardian thought elect cycl would differ unfortun hillari clinton advis beltway advis knew model project call wrong
165,Canadian taxi driver injured in foiled terror plot criticizes police’s negligence,"A taxi driver who suffered minor injuries in a recent foiled terrorist attack in Canada has spoken publicly for the first time, questioning why police didn’t intervene sooner to prevent him from interacting with the suspect. Just over a week ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said a terror suspect was killed after he detonated an explosive device in the back of a taxi in Strathroy, a small Ontario town some 140 miles   of Toronto. Police responded with gunfire and an autopsy showed the man died of a gunshot wound.  Officials in Canada said they were tipped off by the FBI about a “martyrdom video” that showed a   man pledging allegiance to Isis and warning of an imminent attack on a Canadian city. The RCMP identified the man as Aaron Driver  —   who had been flagged by authorities in 2014 after he posted comments online praising the Islamic State group  —   and within hours had surrounded the home where he was living.  But when he pulled up to driveway of Driver’s home last Wednesday, taxi driver Terry Duffield had no indication that anything was amiss. He had often taken Driver to work or shopping and described him as a quiet guy. He waited around five minutes for Driver to emerge from the house.  “Even in the five minutes that I was there, no cop approached the car,” Duffield told the London Free Press in an interview. “Nobody tried to signal me, like get the hell out of the area  —   nothing. They did absolutely nothing to get me out of the car. ” Driver emerged from a side door of the home and once in the cab, asked to be taken to a shopping mall in the city of London, Ontario, a 40 minute drive away.  Duffield was backing out of the driveway when he heard shouts telling him to stop. He checked the rearview mirror. “I see like a Swat team coming up behind my car. As I turn to look at this gentleman [Driver] I see my cigarettes on the front seat which had slid over to the passenger door. ” He told Driver: “I think they’re here to talk to you. ” He reached for his cigarettes, thinking he would step out of the cab for a smoke while police spoke to Driver. The next thing he heard was an explosion.  “I’m laying on the front seat, just terrified. All I’m seeing is white smoke and . .. it looked like ashes in the cab. I could hear people screaming and yelling. I’m yelling: ‘I’m just the driver, I’m just the driver.’  As he sat up, an officer shouted at him to put his hands up. Duffield got out of the cab. Soon after he heard several shots, he said, “and then it was complete silence”. The incident left him with minor cuts on his arm and torso and needing painkillers for a sore back. More than a week has passed since the incident, but the    hasn’t been able to get back in a taxi. He’s currently on medication for anxiety and   stress disorder.  “If I hadn’t leaned over to grab that pack of cigarettes, I probably wouldn’t be talking to you today,” he told the London Free Press. “It was that seat and those cigarettes that saved my ass, no cop. ” He pressed the point when he was interviewed by investigators two days after the incident. “I answered all their questions and then I said to them: ‘You’ve asked me all your questions, I have a question for you: why did the police put my life in jeopardy? Who was watching out for me? ’” The RCMP declined to comment on Duffield’s remarks.  After police learned of Driver’s video, they reached out to transit authorities in Toronto and Ontario to notify them. But in a small town where Driver’s movements were limited to two taxi companies, Duffield wondered why no one called to warn them. “In my eyes, the cops didn’t do their job. If they had’ve, I wouldn’t be in this situation,” he said.  “They never called our cab company once to say, ‘Do not send any cabs into this area in this time frame. There is something going on I can’t tell you (about).’ Nobody called the cab company except the terrorist who called for a ride. ” ",taxi driver suffer minor injuri recent foil terrorist attack canada spoken publicli first time question polic interven sooner prevent interact suspect just week royal canadian mount polic rcmp said terror suspect kill deton explos devic back taxi strathroy small ontario town mile toronto polic respond gunfir autopsi show die gunshot wound offici canada said tip martyrdom video show pledg allegi isi warn immin attack canadian citi rcmp identifi aaron driver flag author post comment onlin prais islam state group within hour surround home live pull driveway driver home last wednesday taxi driver terri duffield indic anyth amiss often taken driver work shop describ quiet wait around five minut driver emerg hous even five minut approach duffield told london free press interview nobodi tri signal like hell area noth they absolut noth driver emerg side door home ask taken shop mall citi london ontario minut drive away duffield back driveway heard shout tell stop check rearview mirror like swat team come behind turn look gentleman driver cigarett front seat slid passeng door told driver think talk reach cigarett think would step smoke polic spoke driver next thing heard explos lay front seat terrifi see white smoke look like ash could hear peopl scream yell yell driver driver offic shout hand duffield soon heard sever shot said complet silenc incid left minor cut torso need painkil sore back more week pass sinc incid abl back taxi current medic anxieti stress disord lean grab pack cigarett probabl talk today told london free press seat cigarett save press point interview investig day incid answer question said ask question question polic life jeopardi watch rcmp declin comment duffield remark after polic learn driver video reach transit author toronto ontario notifi small town driver movement limit taxi compani duffield wonder call warn eye cop situat said they never call compani send cab area time frame there someth go tell nobodi call compani except terrorist call ride
166,Simone Biles takes fourth Rio gold on floor with GB’s Amy Tinkler third,"Sports Illustrated’s cover shoot was out of date before it hit the newsstands. Simone Biles, posing with fellow US   Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky, has three golds around her neck. Expect meme artists to be photoshopping in her fourth already. The sport’s new   said goodbye to Rio with one last victory in the floor final, the fifth female gymnast to take four golds at a single Olympics, and only the third American woman  —   after Ledecky and Missy Franklin  —   to win finish a Games with five medals. And if that was not enough, Zac Efron, her great crush, turned up to support her and give her a victory kiss. Cue many, many pictures on her Twitter feed: “Just call me Mrs Efron already. ” Meanwhile,    Amy Tinkler took bronze to become Britain’s youngest medallist in 32 years. While Biles’ achievement was a   certainty, Tinkler’s podium finish  —   the first for a British woman on the floor  —   left her “in total shock”. “This is crazy,” she said. “I didn’t even expect to make a final, never mind get a medal. ” Like the high bar final for the men, the floor is the most   of the women’s events, hitting the sweet spot on the Venn diagram where pure athleticism meets artistic entertainment and so redolent of childhood trips to the circus that you feel you should be watching with a stick of candyfloss in hand. If Biles could not complete a   clean sweep of five gold medals  —   her bronze on the beam was a whispered reminder of her mortality  —   then she is still a wonder of the sporting world. With her extraordinary    ratio, she packs more tumbles into a single traverse than anyone alive, catapulting her 4ft 8in body into the air is if there are jet packs hidden in the soles of her feet. She looked unusually serious when she was first announced to the crowd. Was there something a little forced in that smile to the judges, that flash of teeth? “My legs felt like rocks,” she admitted later, “but I’ve done floor routines like that before so I wasn’t nervous about it. ” Her usual bounce was back the moment the music began  —   a samba beat to which she wiggled her hips and shimmied her shoulders with a finesse the local crowd loudly appreciated. Witnessing her signature move  —   the double layout with a   on landing  —   in an Olympic final is the gymnastics equivalent of hearing the Beatles playing Sergeant Pepper at the Hollywood Bowl. The crowd here screamed almost as loud when she landed it. Until that point Tinkler’s 14. 933  —   a third of a point above her qualification score  —   had been unexpectedly leading the board. Tinkler, who trains at the entirely pink South Durham Gymnastics Club, has the charisma of a West End dancer. Her background music is a   Pretty Woman   and her reflective leotard made beautiful silver arcs as she sprang winsomely along the diagonals. “I could hear the noise,” she said. “As I was doing the routine they were clapping along. That definitely helps. As soon as I finished my routine, I knew I couldn’t do any better. ” Aly Raisman, however, could. The US team captain performed with the grandeur befitting her status as the defending Olympic champion, and her 15. 500 knocked Tinkler down to third. Vanessa Ferrari  —   who had qualified in third place  —   stood between Tinkler and the podium. The Italian had won a world championship on floor when Tinkler was only seven. She amped up the emotion in a dramatic, romantic routine. The melody of Nessun Dorma strained through the PA, as if pleading with the judges for their consideration. There was a long, long wait as they considered Ferrari’s score. Earlier, Tinkler had clasped her hands tightly as she waited for her own, now she seemed almost nonchalant. “I would have been happy with wherever I was placed,” she admitted afterwards. She did have to redo her mascara before the medal ceremony, though. There is something telling about gymnasts’ floor routines, as if their personality cannot help but seep out of them. Wang Yan of China, for instance, marches stompily round the floor pumping angry little arms and looks like a kid working out her angst in her bedroom. Which, since she is only 16, she may well be doing. It seemed perfectly appropriate that Biles’ last competitive pose in the Olympics should leave her looking at the sky: she has, after all, been reaching for the sun.",sport illustr cover shoot date newsstand simon bile pose fellow michael phelp kati ledecki three gold around neck expect meme artist photoshop fourth alreadi sport said goodby last victori floor final fifth femal gymnast take four gold singl olymp third american woman ledecki missi franklin finish game five medal enough efron great crush turn support give victori kiss mani mani pictur twitter feed just call efron alreadi meanwhil tinkler took bronz becom britain youngest medallist year while bile achiev certainti tinkler podium finish first british woman floor left total shock thi crazi said even expect make final never mind medal like high final floor women event hit sweet spot venn diagram pure athletic meet artist entertain redol childhood trip circu feel watch stick candyfloss hand bile could complet clean sweep five gold medal bronz beam whisper remind mortal still wonder sport world with extraordinari ratio pack tumbl singl travers anyon aliv catapult bodi pack hidden sole feet look unusu seriou first announc crowd someth littl forc smile judg flash teeth leg felt like rock admit later done floor routin like nervou usual bounc back moment music began samba beat wiggl hip shimmi shoulder finess local crowd loudli appreci wit signatur move doubl layout land olymp final gymnast equival hear beatl play sergeant pepper hollywood bowl crowd scream almost loud land until point tinkler third point qualif score unexpectedli lead board tinkler train entir pink south durham gymnast club charisma west dancer background music pretti woman reflect leotard made beauti silver arc sprang winsom along diagon could hear nois said routin clap along that definit help soon finish routin knew better raisman howev could team captain perform grandeur befit statu defend olymp champion knock tinkler third vanessa ferrari qualifi third place stood tinkler podium italian world championship floor tinkler seven amp emot dramat romant routin melodi nessun dorma strain plead judg consider there long long wait consid ferrari score earlier tinkler clasp hand tightli wait seem almost nonchal would happi wherev place admit afterward redo mascara medal ceremoni though there someth tell gymnast floor routin person cannot help seep wang china instanc march stompili round floor pump angri littl arm look like work angst bedroom which sinc well seem perfectli appropri bile last competit pose olymp leav look reach
167,Chuck (aka The Bleeder) review - Liev Schreiber a knockout as the schlub who inspired Rocky,"Hollywood keeps forcefeeding the public boxing movies at an alarming rate. Last year brought Southpaw, as well as Creed, which resurrected the Rocky franchise in rousing fashion already this year, we’ve been treated to Hands of Stone, soon to be followed by Bleed For This. Enter Chuck (aka The Bleeder) a third major film in recent months to feature the sport. Philippe Falardeau’s drama, however, is not a conventional boxing film. There’s no victorious final round, no   retribution, no training montages  —   in fact, there’s hardly any boxing at all, except for a segment where our hero, New Jersey knucklehead Chuck Wepner (Liev Schreiber) gets beaten to a bloody pulp by Muhammad Ali, with whom he endured 15 brutal rounds in 1975. Wepner served as the inspiration for the iconic character of Rocky Balboa, but as The Bleeder makes painfully clear, the   worker was no star athlete. Often referred to as the Bayonne Bleeder, Wepner earned his dubious celebrity on account of his ability to take punishment without going down. On top of getting pummelled by Ali, he also took blows from George Foreman and Sonny Liston. “I just got to show I belong  —   I don’t care about getting hurt,” he says to his second wife Phyllis (Elisabeth Moss) on his way into the ring with Ali. In The Bleeder, Wepner isn’t as a boxer he’s a shameless showman, willing to get bruised to a bloody pulp, just so long as his sacrifice delivers a killer show.  Wepner, played with cocksure swagger by a beefy and imposing Schreiber, often lets his ego get the best of him. If he sees a pretty broad in the street, chances are he’ll try to sleep with her, wooing his conquests with lofty boxing tales. Once Sylvester Stallone appropriates his life story for Rocky, Wepner’s head grows to even bigger proportions, despite the fact he had to fight for any form of payment. Eventually, Chuck’s philandering ways finally catch up to him, forcing Phyllis to kick him out of the house once and for all, and leaving Wepner a   mess. Even as his life descends into chaos following the breakup, Falardeau (The Good Lie) keeps Chuck distinctly jazzy, peppered by a countless slew of jams from the era, and the inspired use of archival footage from the time to visually contextualise Wepner’s world. Falardeau draws exceptional character work from his cast. Schreiber is so good you wish he’d lead more films, while Moss is fiery as always, owning her thick Jersey accent like nobody’s business. Matching them is Schreiber’s   partner Naomi Watts, who’s great fun as a   bartender who acts as a sort of saviour to Wepner. Chuck meanders a bit as it goes along, much like Wepner’s    life  —   but it’s never boring.",hollywood keep forcefeed public box movi alarm rate last year brought southpaw well creed resurrect rocki franchis rous fashion alreadi year treat hand stone soon follow bleed thi enter chuck bleeder third major film recent month featur sport philipp falardeau drama howev convent box film there victori final round retribut train montag fact hardli box except segment hero jersey knucklehead chuck wepner liev schreiber get beaten bloodi pulp muhammad endur brutal round wepner serv inspir icon charact rocki balboa bleeder make pain clear worker star athlet often refer bayonn bleeder wepner earn dubiou celebr account abil take punish without go get pummel also took blow georg foreman sonni liston show belong care get hurt say second wife phylli elisabeth moss ring bleeder wepner boxer shameless showman will bruis bloodi pulp long sacrific deliv killer show wepner play cocksur swagger beefi impos schreiber often let best see pretti broad street chanc sleep woo conquest lofti box tale onc sylvest stallon appropri life stori rocki wepner head grow even bigger proport despit fact fight form payment eventu chuck philand way final catch forc phylli kick hous leav wepner mess even life descend chao follow breakup falardeau good keep chuck distinctli jazzi pepper countless slew jam inspir archiv footag time visual contextualis wepner world falardeau draw except charact work cast schreiber good wish lead film moss fieri alway own thick jersey accent like nobodi busi match schreiber partner naomi watt great bartend act sort saviour wepner chuck meander goe along much like wepner life never bore
168,Obama has failed victims of racism and police brutality,"A long and deep legacy of white supremacy has always arrested the development of US democracy. We either hit it head on, or it comes back to haunt us. That’s why a few of us have pressed the president for seven years not to ignore issues of poverty, police abuse and mass unemployment. Barack Obama said it very well, following the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, that some communities “have been forgotten by all of us”. And now  —   in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Falcon Heights and beyond  —   this legacy has comes back to haunt the whole country.  Obama and his cheerleaders should take responsibility for being so reluctant to engage with these issues. It’s not a question of interest group or constituencies. Unfortunately for so much of the Obama administration its been a question of “I’m not the president of black people, I’m the president of everyone. ” But this is a question of justice. It’s about being concerned about racism and police brutality. I have deep empathy for brothers and sisters who are shot in the police force. I also have profound empathy for people of color who are shot by the police. I have always believed deliberate killing to be a crime against humanity. Yet, Obama didn’t go to Baton Rouge. He didn’t go to Minneapolis. He flew over their heads to go to Dallas. You can’t do that. His fundamental concern was to speak to the police, that was his priority. When he references the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s to speak to the police. But the people who are struggling have a different perspective. The very notion that Dallas is the paragon of policing is something that needs to be interrogated. The Dallas mayor said we have done nothing wrong, but look at your history. Ask people in southern Dallas about the police. Ask Clinton Allen, an unarmed black man fatally shot by the Dallas police in 2013. I was with his mother, Collette Flanagan, the founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality, last year. Countless people came up and told us about all the struggles black communities are having with the Dallas police. Unfortunately, Obama thrives on being in the middle. He has no backbone to fight for justice. He likes to be above the fray. But for those us us who are in the fray, there is a different sensibility. You have to choose which side you’re on, and he doesn’t want to do that. Fundamentally, he’s not a love warrior. He’s a polished professional. Martin Luther King Jr, Adam Clayton Powell Jr and Ella Baker  —   they were warriors. Obama’s attitude is that of a   and they rarely have solidarity with poor and working people. Whatever solidarity he does offer is just   to suffering but he never makes it a priority to end that suffering. Obama has power right now to enact the recommendations made after Ferguson. Better training, independent civilian oversight boards, body cameras. But he has not used executive orders to push any of these changes through. This November, we need change. Yet we are tied in a choice between Trump, who would be a   catastrophe, and Clinton, a   disaster. That’s why I am supporting Jill Stein. I am with her  —   the only progressive woman in the race  —   because we’ve got to get beyond this   situation. I have a deep love for my brother Bernie Sanders, but I disagree with him on Hillary Clinton. I don’t think she would be an “outstanding president”. Her militarism makes the world a less safe place. Clinton policies of the 1990s generated inequality, mass incarceration, privatization of schools and Wall Street domination. There is also a sense that the Clinton policies helped produce the   populism that we’re seeing now in the country. And we think she’s going to come to the rescue? That’s not going to happen. The American empire is in deep spiritual decline and cultural decay. The levels of wealth inequality and environmental degradation is grotesque. The correct response to this is: tell the truth about what is going on. Bear witness. Be willing to go to jail to fight for justice if need be. When the system is declining, it can bring despair. That’s why Black Lives Matter  —   and all other young people of all colors who are mobilizing  —   is a beautiful thing. We are having a moral and spiritual awakening. It gives us democratic hope. Its not about having hope but being hope.

169,Puerto Rico debt relief bill expected to pass US Senate,"A rescue package for   Puerto Rico is likely to clear the final hurdle this week after the bill passed a test vote in the US Senate on Wednesday, by 68 votes to 32. An official vote is likely to take place later on Wednesday or Thursday. The bill would provide emergency debt relief to Puerto Rico, which is expected to default on a $2bn debt payment on Friday. But it was strongly opposed by Bernie Sanders and several other Senate Democrats. Sanders called the bill “disastrous” and a victory for hedge funds. Puerto Rico is in a   recession and has $70bn in debt. The bill, passed by the House earlier this month, would create a control board that would oversee the island’s finances and could supervise some debt restructuring. It would also require the territory to create a fiscal plan and fund public pensions, which the government has underfunded by more than $40bn. “We must act now to prevent matters from getting worse,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said prior to the vote. The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, made a   visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday in a bid to persuade some reluctant Democrats concerned that the board would be too powerful. Democrats have also opposed a provision that would allow the island’s government to lower the minimum wage for some younger workers. Lew urged senators to vote for the bill even though it wasn’t perfect. “The fact that this works and it gives Puerto Rico the ability to move forward is just an overwhelming reason to pass this in a timeframe that prevents the descent into chaos,” Lew said. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, said he would vote for the legislation, though he criticized McConnell for not allowing amendments to the bill. The House is out of session until 5 July, so the Senate will have to pass the House bill unchanged for it to head to the president’s desk for his signature before the Friday deadline. “Ideally, we would like to have an open process   …     but we just don’t have the time here,” said John Cornyn, the Senate majority whip. Prior to the vote, the Texas Republican said that “failure is not an option”.  Some Democrats said they would back the bill, though unenthusiastically. “I’m not going to let the adequate be the enemy of the barely sufficient,” said Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee. Among the Democrats opposed to the bill were Sanders, of Vermont, and Bob Menendez, of New Jersey.  On Tuesday evening, Menendez monopolized the Senate floor for more than four hours, arguing that the bill adopted a colonial approach to the territory, which is home to 3. 5 million US citizens. He said ordinary Puerto Ricans got little say and that the package favored   creditors over island pensioners. Sanders said on Tuesday: “I will do everything I can to defeat this horrific bill. ” He described it as “disastrous” and a victory for hedge funds. “The time has come to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating people of Puerto Rico as American citizens,” he tweeted shortly after the legislature cleared the test vote on Wednesday morning. Some Republican senators planned to vote against it as well. “I’m just not sure we have enough in this bill to ensure they will make the difficult decisions they need to,” Thom Tillis said of the Puerto Rican government. Other Republicans said it was the best path forward. “We’re not going to let Puerto Rico go off a cliff here  —   it’s too important,” said Marco Rubio. The legislation is needed because Puerto Rico, like all US states and territories, cannot declare bankruptcy under federal law, nor can its municipalities and utilities. Supporters warned that if the measure failed to pass before 1 July, the island would face multiple lawsuits from unpaid creditors and could be forced to further cut essential services. Earlier last week, a group of bondholders filed a lawsuit against Puerto Rico’s government after debt negotiations fell apart.  “Plaintiffs have an absolute right to be paid first among all obligations of the Commonwealth, to be paid in full, and to be paid on time,” the lawsuit states.  As several senators remained uncommitted, some bondholder groups worked to turn them against the bill, arguing it did not sufficiently protect bondholders and was tantamount to a bailout for the territory. Several labor unions also lobbied against the measure, arguing in a letter sent to senators that the minimum wage provision could take money out of the Puerto Rican economy. Like Lew, Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro García Padilla, made a   visit to Capitol Hill to lobby for votes. “It’s not perfect, but we need it,” he said between visits with senators.

170,’Ayahuasca is changing global environmental consciousness’,"Ayahuasca, as it has come to be known internationally, is a plant medicine that has been used in the Amazon for centuries for healing and spiritual purposes. Renowned for the often extraordinary visions it induces   not to mention the deep vomiting   it is made from an Amazonian vine known to western science as Banisteriopsis caapi and usually at least one other plant. Over the last 25 years or so ayahuasca has gone global, with many 1000s of people travelling to Peru and other South American countries to drink it, and expert healers   curanderos, shamans, ayahuasqueros, maestros   travelling abroad to hold ceremonies. Many drink ayahuasca because they’re looking for healing, some are just curious, some mistake it for a recreational “drug. ” One of ayahuasca’s pioneer scientific researchers is Dennis McKenna, a US ethnopharmacologist and younger brother of the legendary ethnobotanist and author Terence. Some years ago, in an article titled “Ayahuasca and Human Destiny” published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, McKenna emphasised the contribution ayahuasca can make to physical and spiritual healing   “if it is ever afforded its rightful place in medical practice”   and addressing potential environmental catastrophe.  “[Ayahuasca is] the conduit to a body of profoundly ancient genetic and evolutionary wisdom that has long abided in the cosmologies of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon who have guarded and protected this knowledge for millennia, who learned long ago that the human role is not to be the master of nature, but its stewards,” McKenna wrote. “Our destiny, if we are to survive, is to nurture nature and to learn from it how to nurture ourselves and our fellow beings. This is the lesson that we can learn from ayahuasca, if only we pay attention. ” Below are edited excerpts from an interview between McKenna, in the US, and the Guardian, in Iquitos, a city in Peru’s Amazon which the scientist calls the “epicentre” of the “global ayahuasca movement”: DM: What can [ayahuasca] do for the environmental movement? I think a lot of people, especially if they come to South America, come away with a really renewed appreciation for our connection to and the importance of nature. I think that ayahuasca is a catalytic influence in changing global environmental consciousness, which is something that’s got to happen if we’re going to get out of the mess we’re in. The main challenge we have as a species is   getting on the   for a minute   we have forgotten our connection to nature. We’ve come to the conclusion that we own nature, it exists for us to exploit, and we’re busy doing that. We’re destroying it in the process. We’re destabilising all of these global mechanisms that keep the biosphere habitable by life. I think ayahuasca is waking up a lot of people and reminding them that, “No, that’s not the way it is. You monkeys are not running the show. The plants are running the show, by sustaining life on earth, if nothing else. ” There needs to be a global shift of consciousness. People need to understand this before they can really begin to change, and so in that sense I think ayahuasca is an ambassador from the community of species. The message is basically, “Wake up, you monkeys! You’re wrecking the place!” It’s very important and interesting that so many people come away with this strong message that they’ve really been moved and touched by something that they feel is an intelligent entity   an intelligent representative of the natural world. DH: Why is that? Why does it make clear to people our connection to nature? How does it do that? Because it teaches us that the plants and trees are alive, in a sense, and are intelligent and sentient? DM: I don’t think there is a scientific answer. It’s more like a philosophical answer, or a spiritual answer. This is the challenge of our time: we have separated ourselves from nature and we really need to   that relationship, and as part of the community of species, which we are   we may deny it, we may forget it, but we are part of the community of species. And I think that the community of species is concerned about this problematic primate that they have let loose on the planet. As a species, we are simultaneously the most dangerous thing that has appeared in the course of evolutionary time and we’re also the most promising. Indigenous people have this perspective that [ayahuasca and other plants] are teachers. They exist to give us guidance and wisdom   and I believe that, actually. [Indigenous people] have been the stewards of the plants, the stewards of this knowledge, but I think that now things are getting desperate on a global scale in terms of the environmental catastrophes that are looming. I think there’s a sense in the community of species we’ve got to step up the game and these are their tools to contact human beings and basically say, “Pay attention because you need to   your relationship to nature” and once that’s understood then you have to start making changes. I think one of the challenges of our species   one of our problems   is that we’re very, very clever. We can do amazing things with our big brains and our opposable thumbs and our ability to use and create technology. No doubt that we’re clever. The problem is we’re not wise   and that’s the whole thing. I think the message from ayahuasca and all these other teacher plants is, “Wise up. ” Literally: “Get wise. ” So that we can use the technologies we’ve invented in a way that supports and sustains life, rather than threatens life. That’s really the message. It’s a profound message, but it’s a simple one. DH: Do you feel Peru is the centre of what you call the “global ayahuasca movement” or is it more Brazil?  DM: I think it’s Peru. In terms of its interfacing with the West, or Western culture, in Brazil, where you find it is through churches [like the Uniao do Vegetal] which have adopted ayahuasca as their sacrament. I don’t think there’s a big ayahuasca tourism industry in Brazil. It may be happening, but Iquitos is definitely the epicentre. People have been coming there regularly since about 1995 and it has grown a lot.  DH: Do you think more clinical studies [on ayahuasca] need to be done? That that would be positive for ayahuasca in general? DM: I don’t need clinical studies to convince me ayahuasca is good medicine, that it’s helping people, but you can publish them [and it’s] a good way to convince skeptical colleagues in biomedicine, rather than just some guy raving about how great it is. . . This also grades over into some ethical issues. There are multiple ones. This is something that exists in the context of traditional medicine. It has already, in a certain way, been   by the West through the ayahuasca tourism phenomenon and so on. Is it ethical to try and take a medicine like this and stuff it into a biomedical research structure? Is that the right way to approach it? I’m not saying that it is and I’m not saying that it isn’t. I just think that we have to be clear that there are aspects here of taking something out of its traditional context. Can it be used that effectively in biomedicine, or do you need the ceremonial ambience? It goes back to these hoary principles of setting. Which are very important. Does it have to be traditional? I don’t think so, but you could say, “Well, why not?” Because this is a Peruvian patrimony. Peru has declared ayahuasca a national patrimony, and you could say, “Well, if you’re going to develop therapeutic protocols and programs around ayahuasca, why not do them in Peru?” You’re not taking it away from anybody. You’re actually creating opportunities for Peruvian doctors, scientists and curanderos to work together to develop therapies that can help people   essentially taking a page out of the idea of medical tourism. Tourists are going to come to take ayahuasca for   reasons. Why can’t they come and take it for medical reasons? That’s just an idea. DH: “Medical tourism. ” Have you heard that term used by anyone else [regarding ayahuasca]? DM: Medical tourism is kind of a buzz word now, especially in the States because of the crazy cost structure of so many medical procedures. . . Ayahuasca therapy is not something you can get [here] at least, not legally, so if you want to access it you can go to South America. In that sense it’s medical tourism. . . I think the ayahuasca tourism thing is definitely a   sword. It’s having a lot of negative impacts on indigenous communities, but at the same time it’s benefitting a lot of people and, in some ways, keeping the tradition alive. But it’s also changing that tradition, as people start to cater to Western tastes and needs. So what needs to develop, I think, is some kind of a fusion of traditional and medical practices that takes the best from both and creates some kind of new paradigm. I hope that’s where it goes.  DH: What you said there about negative impacts on indigenous communities. . . What kind of impacts? DM: There are multiple ones, but a lot is related to economics: the foreign tourists come to a place like Iquitos with their pockets full of money and their values and their interests and it can completely skew the economic situation. . . [But] it can also be good. Economic influx in communities can be a good thing if it’s properly done. Another aspect is that most of the centres [offering ayahuasca] around Iquitos aren’t owned by Peruvians. They’re owned by foreigners. That’s fine. They’re the ones that have the resources to set these things up, but then there’s a temptation to not treat their people well, not compensate them well, and then there’s the issue that you get in any kind of   situation where you have a very powerful medicine, you have people coming in to have these experiences, often they’re put in a vulnerable situation because the whole point of the exercise is to go to a place where you can open up and examine your deepest, darkest fears and secrets and so on. If you happen to be with a curandero who doesn’t necessarily have your best interests in mind   there are plenty of those   you can be mistreated. As you know, sexual abuse of foreign tourists in ayahuasca centres is not uncommon. Ayahuasca, like anything else, is a technology. It’s a tool. It really doesn’t have any inherent moral qualities. It can be used in really positive ways and really negative ways because the ethics of it originate in the people who use it and how they use it and what they use it for.  DH: Just to pull back a second. If asked, “Are plants intelligent” would your answer to that be, “Well, obviously, ayahuasca is a good example”? DM: Yes, ayahuasca is intelligent. Yes, plants are intelligent. Not in the way that we are, but in some ways they’re much smarter than we are. It depends on how you want to define intelligence, right? If intelligence doesn’t require nervous systems, it it doesn’t require brains. . . if intelligence is when something reacts to their environment in a way that optimises its adaptation. Under that rubric plants are definitely intelligent   but not like we are. They don’t have brains and they work on different  . This is part of a   we’re seeing.   works on vast   and ayahuasca has only been known to the West for less than 150 years. That’s a tiny slice of historical time. . . I think we’re only beginning to learn how to use ayahuasca, how we use it as a tool to wake up other people because, if you haven’t noticed, there’s a great deal of willful ignorance, at least, in the States, particularly with regard to environmental issues. Our politicians   at least, the Republican side of the equation   are proud of the fact they don’t know anything about climate science and they deny that it is even important. This is the attitude that needs to be changed. Stupidity is not going to solve our problems and yet they’re behaving as though it will. . . Are you familiar with the author Michael Pollan?  DH: Yes. Food Rules [the title of a book by Pollan].  DM: He wrote a wonderful article in The New Yorker. The Intelligent Plant. I think it really well summarises some of the issues right now that science is looking at, in terms of plant intelligence. I mean, a few years ago, you bring that up, you’d just be laughed at. Now, not so much. There’s really compelling evidence that plants are capable of planning, remembering, dealing with other plants and other things. . . Something else we’re learning about intelligence: you don’t have to have a brain. Brains are   you know. What you have to have is neural networks   very extensive networks of connections. If you look at   if you look at forests, if you look at things on the   these are tremendous, enormous neural networks. You can think of them from that perspective, like the connections between the roots of plants and the fungi in the soil. These are mycelial networks that can sometimes cover many miles. The biggest organisms in the world are actually mushrooms, believe it or not. Not psychedelic ones, as far as we know, but they’re mushrooms that grow in the forests in Oregon, places like this. They’re a cubic mile in extent. They’re 80, 000 years old. Because the mushroom part is just the reproductive body. What’s really going on is the mycelial networks in the soil: the hyphae of the fungi is closely associated with the roots of plants, so it’s a very, very close symbiotic association. This is the intelligence of plants. This is the real thing. This is not just a romantic notion. This actually is real. It’s sometimes called the Gaia Hypothesis, originated by James Lovelock, a geophysicist and geochemist. . . His basic idea is that the entire biosphere is regulated, working together in such a way to keep it within these fairly narrow parameters that will support life. DH: One more thing on plant intelligence. . . There was a book recently published, Brilliant Green, written by an Italian, Stefano Mancuso. DM: He’s one of the leading researchers on this right now. DH: I read the book by Mancuso, which really got me thinking. One of the things he doesn’t address is the idea that plants teach humans, that there is that kind of relationship.  DM: It’s a bit of a leap for him, but it is definitely where this is trending. DH: Are you continuing with your scientific research into ayahuasca at the moment? DM: Well, not so much, but I’m interested in moving in to the therapeutic area and I would like to do some structured chemical, clinical studies. But I want to do them in Peru. And I organize retreats in the Sacred Valley [in the Cusco region] at Willka T’ika.  DH: Can I just finish with one more question, Dennis? You say in “Human Destiny” [the article published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs] “You monkeys only think you’re running things. ” And that’s quoted, as if someone else said it. Is that what your brother Terence said, or is that what you said at some point? DM: It’s what the ayahuasca said. DH: To who? DM: Me.  DH: Ok. And what does it mean? Is the play on “You monkeys only think you’re running things?” or am I reading too much into it? DM: When I took ayahuasca with the Uniao do Vegetal for the first time, in Sao Paulo in 1991, I had a very impactful ayahuasca experience in which I was shown photosynthesis at the molecular level. Being a plant biochemist I sort of understand these processes. It was extremely inspiring to me at the time. The   lesson was, “You monkeys only think you’re running the show. ” It’s in my book [The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss].",ayahuasca come known intern plant medicin use amazon centuri heal

171,Why Ghostbros on Twitter are monstering my Ghostbusters review,"There were two things that didn’t surprise me about Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters reboot. The first was that I had a lot of fun watching it. After all, I had loved Feig’s last three comedies with Melissa McCarthy, who fronts the   revamp alongside Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones.  The second predictable thing was that the same diehard fanboys of Ivan Reitman’s 80s originals who succeeded in making the first trailer for the film the most disliked in YouTube history wouldn’t change their tune despite the film receiving a generally warm reception from critics. It currently boasts a 78% fresh score on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, notably higher than Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, the last big comedy to hit cinemas. If anything, the positive reaction seems to have angered the film’s detractors a great deal more, inciting them to target writers like myself for the having the temerity to fall prey to the charms of Feig’s revisionist action comedy.  For liking it, I was criticized for “pandering to politically correct, radical feminist rubbish” by one reader, a sentiment echoed by another who tweeted that I “played it safe to stay politically correct” for labelling Feig’s achievement a “blast”. Many libelously accused me of accepting money from Sony Pictures to solicit a warm response. And it wasn’t just one or two tweets targeting me, but a host.  The film has since opened in the UK (it opens in the US on Friday) but over the weekend, when the Ghostbros (as they’re commonly referred to now) went on the attack, no one apart from a small pool of critics had watched the film  —   meaning they were trashing it sight unseen. It’s likely they’re to blame for the film’s drastically low rating on IMDb, where over 57% of users gave it the lowest possible score. On Reddit, some have banded together in a spiteful effort to keep the favorable reviews from appearing on the   website.  It’s commonplace for fervent fans to lambast writers for disliking a film they champion. MTV’s chief film critic, Amy Nicholson, faced such a backlash in 2012, when she dared express her reservations about Marvel’s The Avengers in her lukewarm review for Box Office Magazine. But for people to chastise journalists for liking a film? That’s virtually unheard of. I’ll freely admit that the first Ghostbusters trailer, so widely criticized by fans of the original, left me largely underwhelmed. The pacing seemed off, the jokes too few and far between, and the chemistry lacking. Even McCarthy found it “very confusing”. And yet, I maintained hope that Feig and his hugely talented quartet would deliver. Feig is a pro at conducting comedic chaos, much like Reitman before him his leading ladies are all proven comic dynamos. Also, the prospect of a   blockbuster is downright revolutionary: how could that not be cause for celebration? It’s that latter, and vital, aspect that naysayers who have yet to see Ghostbusters will vehemently disavow as the reason they’re not jazzed for the latest iteration. The below tweet does a solid job of summing up much of their harebrained defense: Yet few, if any, people complained that their childhoods were being stolen when word got out that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were going undercover for a   update of 21 Jump Street, the beloved 80s show that introduced the world to Johnny Depp. If any movie franchise begged to be retooled for a new generation, Ghostbusters was surely it. In the 32 years since the release of the first entry, there have been spectacular advances in special effects. Also, the original, while fun and inspired, is by no means a masterpiece on par with classic comedies such as Some Like It Hot or Dr Strangelove.  Why is it considered sacrilege to use the blueprint of Reitman’s film as the basis for a new supernatural comedy? The only possible explanation: it stars women. If you’re all for furthering the advancement of women in Hollywood, the strong Ghostbusters reviews should be a cause for pleasure. If the film’s warm critical response bugs you  —   especially if you haven’t even seen it  —   that, sadly, says a lot.",there thing surpris paul feig ghostbust reboot first watch after love feig last three comedi melissa mccarthi front revamp alongsid kristen wiig kate mckinnon lesli jone second predict thing diehard fanboy ivan reitman origin succeed make first trailer film dislik youtub histori chang tune despit film receiv gener warm recept critic current boast fresh score review aggreg rotten tomato notabl higher mike dave need wed date last comedi cinema anyth posit reaction seem anger film detractor great deal incit target writer like temer fall prey charm feig revisionist action comedi like critic pander polit correct radic feminist rubbish reader sentiment echo anoth tweet play safe stay polit correct label feig achiev blast mani libel accus accept money soni pictur solicit warm respons tweet target host film sinc open open friday weekend ghostbro commonli refer went attack apart small pool critic watch film mean trash sight unseen like blame film drastic rate imdb user gave lowest possibl score reddit band togeth spite effort keep favor review appear websit commonplac fervent fan lambast writer dislik film champion chief film critic nicholson face backlash dare express reserv marvel aveng lukewarm review offic magazin peopl chastis journalist like film that virtual unheard freeli admit first ghostbust trailer wide critic fan origin left larg underwhelm pace seem joke chemistri lack even mccarthi found confus maintain hope feig huge talent quartet would deliv feig conduct comed chao much like reitman lead ladi proven comic dynamo also prospect blockbust downright revolutionari could caus celebr latter vital aspect naysay ghostbust vehement disavow reason jazz latest iter tweet solid sum much harebrain defens peopl complain childhood stolen word chan tatum jonah hill go undercov updat jump street belov show introduc world johnni depp movi franchis beg retool gener ghostbust sure year sinc releas first entri spectacular advanc special effect also origin inspir mean masterpiec classic comedi some like strangelov consid sacrileg blueprint reitman film basi supernatur comedi possibl explan star women further advanc women hollywood strong ghostbust review caus pleasur film warm critic respons bug especi even seen sadli say
172,The town that reveals how Russia spills two Deepwater Horizons of oil each year,"The Komi Republic in northern Russia is renowned for its many lakes, but sites contaminated by oil are almost just as easy to find in the Usinsk oilfields. From pumps dripping oil and huge ponds of black sludge to dying trees and undergrowth  —   a likely sign of an underground pipeline leak  —   these spills are relatively small and rarely garner media attention. But they add up quickly, threatening fish stocks, pasture land and drinking water. According to the natural resources and environment minister, Sergei Donskoi, 1. 5m tonnes of oil are spilled in Russia each year. That’s more than twice the amount released by the   Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The main problem, according to the natural resources ministry, is that 60% of pipeline infrastructure is deteriorated. And with fines inexpensive and oversight lax, oil companies find it more profitable to patch up holes and pour sand on spills  —   or do nothing at all  —   than invest in quality infrastructure and comprehensive cleanups, according to activists. “The pipelines are very worn out, they’re left over from the USSR,” said Greenpeace research projects coordinator, Vasily Yablokov. “The oil companies have realised they’re losing a lot of oil and are starting to replace them, but it’s laughable. They need to do much more. ” While Russia’s oil and gas production provides more than half the state budget every year, it exacts a huge price on the environment and local residents. A state energy statistics bureau told Greenpeace it had registered 11, 709 pipeline breaks in Russia in 2014. In contrast, Canada reported five pipeline accidents (involving human injury) and 133 incidents involving natural gas and oil pipelines in 2014. The Komi Republic is where Russia’s first oil production facility opened in 1745, and the Soviet Union started developing the country’s modern oil industry here in the 1960s and 70s. Usinsk, a sleepy town of 39, 000 people, is the regional oil hub. The Usinsk oil field is licensed largely to Lukoil, which bought its Komi oil drilling assets from Komitek in 1999 and began expanding production. “More Usinsk oil to the motherland!” giant letters proclaim on top of one prefab flat block. Just south of the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn’t even set in Usinsk in the summer, and it’s reachable by car only when rivers freeze to make “winter roads”.  Komi’s aging oil infrastructure has been prone to accidents. In 1994, a pipeline break in Usinsk gushed up more than 60, 000 tonnes of oil (many estimates put that figure at twice as much) one of the biggest spills ever on land. Spills in 2013, 2014 and 2015 released hundreds of tonnes of oil on to the snow and river ice. Greenpeace says that in 2014, a   “oil patrol” by its volunteers discovered 201 contaminated sites (mostly from pipeline breaks) in the Usinsk oilfield, which is licensed largely to Lukoil, and filed official complaints for each. A trip organised by Greenpeace and the local news site 7x7 in July reported that at least six of these sites were still filled with oil. At a meeting with journalists and Greenpeace,   representatives said the 201 sites had been investigated and no oil spill was found at 67 of them. However, Greenpeace has photographs of violations at every site. Representatives admitted the subcontractor that checked the sites could have mistaken the coordinates of some of them. According to Lukoil spokesman Sergei Makarov, a new programme by the company has liquidated more than 50 pools of leaked oil. But since satellite imagery has shown likely spills in areas of the Usinsk oilfields that Greenpeace cannot access, the actual number of contaminated sites is likely far higher than 201, Yablokov believes. “It’s like a train that they’re laying rails under as it goes, it goes further and they lay more rail, and that train is oil extraction in the regions,” Yablokov said. Besides the six known sites, Greenpeace said the July visit also found three new oil spills along the way, including one near a site that Greenpeace volunteers removed 20 tonnes of oil from in 2014. At the site of one pipeline break, the Guardian saw that a large amount of oil had been removed by Lukoil workers and the site considered “reclaimed”. But the haphazard canals   it were still full of thick, unctuous water with a rainbow film on top, and white paint on the birch tree trunks could not cover the black trace of oil, Greenpeace says. Locals in the villages around Usinsk complain that the frequent oil spills pollute their drinking water, contaminate the river fish and reindeer they depend on for food and cause chronic health conditions.  Statistics obtained in 2010 by local activists from the hospital in   a village of 1, 300 on the Pechora river that has suffered from many of the large spills, showed rises in almost every kind of illness. Nervous system illnesses in adults, for instance, grew from 26 in 1995 to 70 in 2009. In patients under 18 years of age, they skyrocketed from 72 to 254.  Spokesman Sergei Makarov said   was investing 20bn roubles (£230m) in environmental measures and would change 370km of old pipeline in 2016, out of a   pipeline network in the region. The company reported only six oil spills in 2015, although Makarov admitted “some of our employees don’t want to report (spills) because a leak means poor quality work”.  In late May, more than 50 residents of   protested the effects of oil drilling and plans for a new oil well near the village. Lukoil Komi plans to increase its production from 15. 8m tonnes of oil in 2014 to 21. 5m tonnes in 2019. “We’re not telling oil companies to leave, we are saying drill in a way so that we can live with clean air and water,” local biology teacher and activist Yekaterina Dyachkova said. “Of course we depend on oil companies because there is no other work. ” The aftermath of oil spills isn’t limited to Komi. Northern rivers such as the Pechora carry 500, 000 tonnes of oil into the Arctic Ocean every year, the state hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring service reported in 2011. More than 11, 000 people have signed a Greenpeace petition demanding oil companies be required to replace by 2022 all oil pipelines more than 25 years old. Without stricter enforcement, the situation is unlikely to change. The average return on assets for oil companies in Russia was twice as high as in other countries, according to a recent Greenpeace report. That’s thanks to huge government tax breaks and subsidies, as well as “conditions in which oil companies are able to avoid full financial responsibility for oil spills” and not replace pipelines, it said. “We need the cost of oil drilling to include protecting nature,” Yablokov said. “It won’t be quite as profitable a business, but we will be able to preserve the environment. ”",komi republ northern russia renown mani lake site contamin almost easi find usinsk oilfield from pump drip huge pond black sludg die tree undergrowth like sign underground pipelin leak spill rel small rare garner media attent quickli threaten fish stock pastur land drink water accord natur resourc environ minist sergei donskoi tonn spill russia year that twice amount releas deepwat horizon spill gulf mexico main problem accord natur resourc ministri pipelin infrastructur deterior fine inexpens oversight compani find profit patch hole pour sand spill noth invest qualiti infrastructur comprehens cleanup accord activist pipelin worn left ussr said greenpeac research project coordin vasili yablokov compani realis lose start replac laughabl they need much while russia product provid half state budget everi year exact huge price environ local resid state energi statist bureau told greenpeac regist pipelin break russia contrast canada report five pipelin accid involv human injuri incid involv natur pipelin komi republ russia first product facil open soviet union start develop countri modern industri usinsk sleepi town peopl region usinsk field licens larg lukoil bought komi drill asset komitek began expand product more usinsk motherland giant letter proclaim prefab flat block just south arctic circl even usinsk summer reachabl river freez make winter road komi age infrastructur prone accid pipelin break usinsk gush tonn mani estim figur twice much biggest spill ever land spill releas hundr tonn snow river greenpeac say patrol volunt discov contamin site mostli pipelin break usinsk oilfield licens larg lukoil file offici complaint trip organis greenpeac local news site juli report least site still fill meet journalist greenpeac repres said site investig spill found howev greenpeac photograph violat everi site repres admit subcontractor check site could mistaken coordin accord lukoil spokesman sergei makarov programm compani liquid pool leak sinc satellit imageri shown like spill area usinsk oilfield greenpeac cannot access actual number contamin site like higher yablokov believ like train lay rail goe goe rail train extract region yablokov said besid known site greenpeac said juli visit also found three spill along includ near site greenpeac volunt remov tonn site pipelin break guardian larg amount remov lukoil worker site consid reclaim haphazard canal still full thick unctuou water rainbow film white paint birch tree trunk could cover black trace greenpeac say local villag around usinsk complain frequent spill pollut drink water contamin river fish reindeer depend food caus chronic health condit statist obtain local activist hospit villag pechora river suffer mani larg spill show rise almost everi kind ill nervou system ill adult instanc grew patient year skyrocket spokesman sergei makarov said invest roubl environment measur would chang pipelin pipelin network region compani report spill although makarov admit employe want report spill leak mean poor qualiti work late resid protest effect drill plan well near villag lukoil komi plan increas product tonn tonn tell compani leav say drill live clean water local biolog teacher activist yekaterina dyachkova said cours depend compani work aftermath spill limit komi northern river pechora carri tonn arctic ocean everi year state hydrometeorolog environment monitor servic report more peopl sign greenpeac petit demand compani requir replac pipelin year without stricter enforc situat unlik chang averag return asset compani russia twice high countri accord recent greenpeac report that thank huge govern break subsidi well condit compani abl avoid full financi respons spill replac pipelin said need cost drill includ protect natur yablokov said quit profit busi abl preserv environ
173,"On your marks, get set, wait: traffic jams clog Rio ahead of Olympic Games","Special traffic regulations giving priority to athletes and VIP visitors to the Rio 2016 games have caused 20km (12. 5 mile) traffic jams in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, days ahead of the opening ceremony.  Since the new dedicated Olympic lanes opened on Monday, traffic during the morning rush hour has been reduced to a crawl with average speeds of less than 15 km per hour, according to O Globo. City officials hope the congestion will be eased by a new metro extension, which opened on Monday  —   more than two years behind schedule. But for the duration of the Games, the gleaming new subway service will only be available to Olympic ticket and pass holders. Commuters will not be allowed to use the extension until the end of the year. To further reduce gridlock, schools will be closed for the duration of the Games and Mayor Eduardo Paes has declared four local holidays on key dates: this Thursday for the torch relay’s arrival in the city on Friday for the opening ceremony, 18 August for the triathlon and on the Monday after the closing ceremony, when 100, 000 visitors are expected to leave Rio. Rio is the fourth worst city in the world for traffic jams, according to one index. Even though the government has spent more than £800m ($1, 070) on new highways and rapid bus transport systems to alleviate the problems ahead of the Games, drivers often find journey times double or triple as a result of congestion, particularly around the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (where the Olympic rowing will be staged) and on the road between the South Zone and Barra da Tijuca (the site of the Olympic Park). The new metro is only a partial solution because it stops more than 10km short of the Games venues. For the remainder of the journey, visitors will have to use buses or taxis. Efforts to improve mobility have been complicated by numerous bomb scares, the most recent of which forced the temporary closure of Santos Dumont airport. It was a false alarm, one of more than half a dozen in the past two weeks.",special traffic regul give prioriti athlet visitor game caus mile traffic jam street janeiro day ahead open ceremoni sinc dedic olymp lane open monday traffic morn rush hour reduc crawl averag speed less hour accord globo citi offici hope congest eas metro extens open monday year behind schedul durat game gleam subway servic avail olymp ticket pass holder commut allow extens year reduc gridlock school close durat game mayor eduardo pae declar four local holiday date thursday torch relay arriv citi friday open ceremoni august triathlon monday close ceremoni visitor expect leav fourth worst citi world traffic jam accord index even though govern spent highway rapid transport system allevi problem ahead game driver often find journey time doubl tripl result congest particularli around rodrigo freita lagoon olymp row stage road south zone barra tijuca site olymp park metro partial solut stop short game venu remaind journey visitor buse taxi effort improv mobil complic numer bomb scare recent forc temporari closur santo dumont airport fals alarm half dozen past week
174,Benjamin Patterson: the Fluxus artist who composed with ants,"Benjamin Patterson was there at the very beginning of Fluxus, performing his own composition at the first concert   by George Maciunas in Germany, in 1962. Yet while   figures such as Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik and La Monte Young have all enjoyed a certain purchase with   habitués (even among those who may not be intimately familiar with specific works) the contributions of this bassist, sculptor, painter and collagist have not been placed at the center of conceptual art’s history after Dada. At least not yet. In recent years there have been indications that Patterson’s reputation is on the rise thanks to a slate of archival audio releases, a comprehensive 2010 exhibition of old and newer pieces at Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, as well as similar programming at the Studio Museum in Harlem. And while Patterson’s death last week, at age 82, puts an end to the story of his creations and improvisations, it also offers an opportunity to assess more accurately the scope and impact of this African American artist’s groundbreaking work. He was classically trained on the   only to discover that America was not ready to hire black symphony musicians. So he found another way to leave his mark: before Gyorgy Ligeti and Peter Maxwell Davies collaborated with the African American singer William Pearson, the baritone was featured alongside Patterson in a performance of his Duo For Voice And a String Instrument  —   one of the pieces presented at the first Fluxus concert. According to the composer, sometime jazz trombonist and Columbia professor of American music George Lewis, “Ben’s work was laconic, whimsical, convivial and probing by turns. ” In an email exchange, Lewis says that Patterson “crossed boundaries between visual art, music, and performance with alacrity” and added that the artist’s early   piece, Variations for a Double Bass, “anticipated by a decade the materiality of Helmut Lachenmann, while his even more influential Paper Piece encouraged audiences to enact and exchange personal and communitarian visions in sound and gesture. ” Patterson’s openness to indeterminacy and his welcoming of audience participation fit neatly within the parameters of Fluxus’s charm, which was typically driven by chance and ephemerality. Though even as he helped codify the practices of “action as composition” Patterson pushed himself to create works that offered a substantive feel running in parallel with a   modern art concept. The gestation of his 1960s piece Ants gives a sense of the artist’s playfulness and his deliberate method. It started as a visual idea: Patterson began composing Ants by holding its titular specimens in reserve, then allowing them to escape across a piece of white paper. After photographing this exodus from his custody, Patterson observed the ants’ positions on the resulting photographs, and transcribed these positions as notes on musical staffs. (You can find reproductions of each stage in this invaluable exhibition book and CD package.) Patterson’s hypothesis was that this could be a new approach to aleatoric (or “chance based”) music. However, “a   on my   was quite disappointing,” Patterson wrote. “Only much later did I realize that what I had discovered was a ‘method’   …     and of course a ‘method’ is not ‘music’. ” In 1964, Patterson reopened his ant files and came up with notated music that he decided should be presented “in conjunction” with any 1962 “composition” by Maciunas  —   what with simultaneity being another frequent component of Fluxus work. A recording of Ants by German pianist Steffen Schleiermacher, released on the highly enjoyable 2015 album Fluxus Piano, reveals that Patterson’s final score favors some of the jabbing, pointillistic violence of the era’s “serial music” modernism. The shattering musical shards are interesting on their own  —   though it’s also fascinating to hear in conjunction with another Maciunas piece. (The composition superimposed over Ants on Schleiermacher’s album is Maciunas’s   work Solo for Sick Man.) As it happened, Patterson once intended to study with one of the era’s priests of atonal complexity, Karlheinz Stockhausen. But their meeting went so poorly that Patterson said he “went into isolation for three days to ponder a more socially responsible way of making art”. After an unplanned encounter with John Cage and pianist David Tudor resulted in an invitation to play at a concert soon thereafter, Patterson’s move toward more   music was settled  —   and Paper Piece followed quickly. By the end of the 60s, Patterson had retired from the art world. His stated reasons involved needing to provide for his family he soon obtained a degree in library science (and over time, he also established a noteworthy career as an arts administrator). But in his writings, he also expressed some distress over the inability of Fluxus to deal with the politics of its era. “In general I think Fluxus did sit on the fence,” Patterson wrote. “True, many of the Fluxus artists during that time were very willing to ‘confess’ to harmless friends that they were really anarchists, communists, socialists   something or other in that direction. But I must state that I never got a telephone call from ‘Fluxus Central’ asking me to join next Saturday’s March on Washington  —   for any purpose.   …     Yes, I was disgusted, and yes, the lack of support for civil rights and antiwar efforts was an important factor in my subsequent ‘retirement’ from the art scene. ” This uneasy relationship between Patterson’s artistic legacy and his racial identity was not resolved by his early retirement, either. In her introduction to the exhibition book that accompanied Houston’s 2010 exhibition, senior curator Valerie Cassel Oliver recounted seeing photographs of early Fluxus activities and thinking “Who is the black man in this picture?” The answer she discovered, over her years working with Patterson, was that he was “a radical presence in the midst of a radical avant garde”. “Historians of experimentalism still seem unsure as to how to engage Ben as an African American artist,” Lewis told me. “While Ben was hardly disengaged from African American history and culture, his work was rooted in a mobile, fluid cosmopolitanism that declined to be overdetermined by race. ” And while Lewis notes that Fluxus publications of the period were scrupulous about documenting Patterson’s contributions, he says the same has not proved true in the   literature. “At least part of that could be due to Ben’s own modesty and ” Lewis said. “He was hardly a tireless  .   …     [But] when you look at how his work is portrayed in scholarly histories, though, you become obliged to call into question the reasons for the discrepancies between those histories and what his fellow artists said and experienced. ” After his children grew up and left the home, Patterson returned to    —   diving back into readymades and collages, but also moving into new forms of sculpture and painting, many of which Oliver presented in Houston. Over email, the curator remembered Patterson as “thoughtful, kind and filled with enormous curiosity and a zeal for life. His many works  —   whether visual art objects, scores for actions or performances  —   were so layered and multifaceted that it took a moment to realize that they were built upon rigorous research, cloaked in a witty haiku. ”  Oliver also forwarded news of a   final project, too: specifically, an online lottery meant to crowdfund a portrait book covering 25 years of Fluxus activity. The drawing will be held on 2 September, in Germany, in lieu of a funeral, which an associate there said “he did not want”. “He died doing what he loved best, making art,” Oliver said. “I feel so immensely privileged to have shared his brilliance with the world. ” That sentiment was echoed by Schleiermacher, the German pianist, when I reached him over email to ask how he chose which Maciunas piece would go with his performance of Patterson’s music. Outside of assuring me that the superimposition of Fluxus pieces was achieved “according to strict Cagean chance operations,” he said “Patterson’s Ants will continue their wanderings  —   and who knows where Patterson and his double bass will wander now. In any case, Fluxus will go on. ”",benjamin patterson begin fluxu perform composit first concert georg maciuna germani figur yoko june paik mont young enjoy certain purchas habitu even among intim familiar specif work contribut bassist sculptor painter collagist place center conceptu histori dada least recent year indic patterson reput rise thank slate archiv audio releas comprehens exhibit newer piec contemporari art museum houston well similar program studio museum harlem patterson death last week put stori creation improvis also offer opportun assess accur scope impact african american artist groundbreak work classic train discov america readi hire black symphoni musician found anoth leav mark gyorgi ligeti peter maxwel davi collabor african american singer william pearson bariton featur alongsid patterson perform voic string instrument piec present first fluxu concert accord compos sometim jazz trombonist columbia professor american music georg lewi work lacon whimsic convivi probe turn email exchang lewi say patterson cross boundari visual music perform alacr ad artist earli piec variat doubl bass anticip decad materi helmut lachenmann even influenti paper piec encourag audienc enact exchang person communitarian vision sound gestur patterson open indeterminaci welcom audienc particip neatli within paramet fluxu charm typic driven chanc ephemer though even help codifi practic action composit patterson push creat work offer substant feel run parallel modern concept gestat piec ant give sens artist play deliber method start visual idea patterson began compos ant hold titular specimen reserv allow escap across piec white paper after photograph exodu custodi patterson observ ant posit result photograph transcrib posit note music staff find reproduct stage invalu exhibit book packag patterson hypothesi could approach aleator chanc base music howev quit disappoint patterson wrote onli much later realiz discov method cours method music patterson reopen file came notat music decid present conjunct composit maciuna simultan anoth frequent compon fluxu work record ant german pianist steffen schleiermach releas highli enjoy album fluxu piano reveal patterson final score favor jab pointillist violenc serial music modern shatter music shard interest though also fascin hear conjunct anoth maciuna piec composit superimpos ant schleiermach album maciuna work solo sick happen patterson intend studi priest aton complex karlheinz stockhausen meet went poorli patterson said went isol three day ponder social respons make after unplan encount john cage pianist david tudor result invit play concert soon thereaft patterson move toward music settl paper piec follow quickli patterson retir world state reason involv need provid famili soon obtain degre librari scienc time also establish noteworthi career art administr write also express distress inabl fluxu deal polit gener think fluxu fenc patterson wrote true mani fluxu artist time will confess harmless friend realli anarchist communist socialist someth direct must state never telephon call fluxu central ask join next saturday march washington purpos disgust lack support civil right antiwar effort import factor subsequ retir scene thi uneasi relationship patterson artist legaci racial ident resolv earli retir either introduct exhibit book accompani houston exhibit senior curat valeri cassel oliv recount see photograph earli fluxu activ think black pictur answer discov year work patterson radic presenc midst radic avant gard historian experiment still seem unsur engag african american artist lewi told while hardli disengag african american histori cultur work root mobil fluid cosmopolitan declin overdetermin race lewi note fluxu public period scrupul document patterson contribut say prove true literatur least part could modesti lewi said hardli tireless look work portray scholarli histori though becom oblig call question reason discrep histori fellow artist said experienc after children grew left home patterson return dive back readymad collag also move form sculptur paint mani oliv present houston over email curat rememb patterson thought kind fill enorm curios zeal life mani work whether visual object score action perform layer multifacet took moment realiz built upon rigor research cloak witti haiku oliv also forward news final project specif onlin lotteri meant crowdfund portrait book cover year fluxu activ draw held septemb germani lieu funer associ said want die love best make oliv said feel immens privileg share brillianc world that sentiment echo schleiermach german pianist reach email chose maciuna piec would perform patterson music outsid assur superimposit fluxu piec achiev accord strict cagean chanc oper said patterson ant continu wander know patterson doubl bass wander case fluxu
175,"Second bank hit by ’sophisticated’ malware attack, says Swift","Swift, the global financial messaging network that banks use to move billions of dollars every day, warned on Thursday of a second malware attack similar to the one that led to February’s $81 million cyberheist at the Bangladesh central bank. The second case targeted a commercial bank, Swift spokeswoman Natasha de Teran said, without naming it. It was not immediately clear how much money, if any, was stolen in the second attack.  Swift said in a statement that the attackers exhibited a “deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operational controls” at targeted banks and may have been aided by “malicious insiders or cyber attacks, or a combination of both”. The organization, a Belgian   owned by member banks, said that forensic experts believe the second case showed that the Bangladesh heist was not a single occurrence, “but part of a wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.“  News of a second case comes as law enforcement authorities in Bangladesh and elsewhere investigate the February cyber theft from the Bangladesh central bank account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Swift has acknowledged that that scheme involved altering Swift software to hide evidence of fraudulent transfers, but that its core messaging system was not harmed. In both cases Swift said insiders or cyber attackers had succeeded in penetrating the targeted banks’ systems, obtaining user credentials and submitting fraudulent Swift messages that correspond with transfers of money.  In the second case SWIFT said attackers had also used a kind of malware called a “Trojan PDF reader” to manipulate PDF reports confirming the messages in order to hide their tracks.",swift global financi messag network bank move billion dollar everi warn thursday second malwar attack similar februari million cyberheist bangladesh central bank second case target commerci bank swift spokeswoman natasha teran said without name immedi clear much money stolen second attack swift said statement attack exhibit deep sophist knowledg specif oper control target bank aid malici insid cyber attack combin organ belgian own member bank said forens expert believ second case show bangladesh heist singl occurr part wider highli adapt campaign target bank new second case come enforc author bangladesh elsewher investig februari cyber theft bangladesh central bank account york feder reserv bank swift acknowledg scheme involv alter swift softwar hide evid fraudul transfer core messag system harm case swift said insid cyber attack succeed penetr target bank system obtain user credenti submit fraudul swift messag correspond transfer money second case swift said attack also use kind malwar call trojan reader manipul report confirm messag order hide track
176,Tens of thousands evacuated as Israeli wildfires rage,"France, Russia, Turkey and Cyprus are to send firefighting planes to Israel as the country battles fierce forest fires that have triggered the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, including 11 neighbourhoods in Haifa. Strengthening east winds on top of warm, dry weather have helped spread the blazes in several areas of the country for a third day, including outside Jerusalem, where fires temporarily closed the main motorway linking the city to Tel Aviv. Haifa, however, was the worst affected, with fires starting out in the   of the port city near Paz Bridge and spreading to near the city’s football stadium. About 50, 000 people have been evacuated from the city as a precaution. Haifa’s civilian airport was closed on Thursday, while local media reported plans to evacuate prisons. “We evacuated three neighbourhoods and there are people who are stuck,” a fire department spokesman, Kayed Daher, said of the situation in Haifa earlier in the day. “The fire is still burning and the flames are approaching a gas [petrol] station. ” The fires are the worst since 2010, when Israel suffered its single deadliest wildfire it killed 42 people and was extinguished only after firefighting aircraft from as far away as the US were dispatched to bring it under control. The Palestinian Authority, which sent firefighters in 2010, has also offered to join the international effort to extinguish the blazes. The fires started on Monday in Neve Shalom, outside Jerusalem, before spreading. Hundreds of homes have been damaged and a dozen people treated for smoke inhalation. Despite claims by Israel’s security minister, Gilad Erdan, that 50% of the fires were “apparently arson” the Israel police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said investigators had not yet been able to determine whether any of the dozens of fires countrywide had been set deliberately.  The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said if proof was discovered that any of the fires were deliberately sparked they would be treated as acts of “terror”. “Every fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terror and will be treated as such accordingly,” he told reporters in Haifa near the scene of the fires. Israel’s police chief, Roni Alsheich, told reporters that arsonists were suspected of setting some of the fires for political reasons. “It’s safe to assume that whoever is setting the fires isn’t doing it only out of pyromania,” he said. “If it is arson, it is politically motivated. ” Naftali Bennett, the leader of the     Jewish Home party, suggested on Twitter that arsonists were disloyal to the state, and that those who set the fires could not be Jewish. “Only those to whom the country does not belong are capable of burning it,” he said in a tweet in Hebrew.  Bennett provided no evidence to support his claims.

177,Late-night roasts Trump after debate: ’His head doesn’t have room for facts’,"Among   TV hosts, the consensus on who won Monday night’s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is resoundingly clear: Clinton dominated the evening, with Trump emerging as the blustering loser. The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert all opted to air live following the first of three presidential debates, to offer comedic and pointed roundups of the chaotic clash. Trevor Noah’s Daily Show was the first up, with the host opening by taking a swipe at moderator Lester Holt, who New Yorker humorist Andy Borowitz mocked in a piece titled “CNN Launches Manhunt after Lester Holt Vanishes from Debate”. After playing a montage of the debate’s most heated exchanges, Noah said: “At that point, Lester Holt wasn’t even moderating anymore, he was just eating popcorn like everyone else. ”  Noah, however, saved most of his attacks for Trump, who still refused to release his tax returns, and instead boasted about his income while suggesting he was “smart” for not paying income tax. “I’m sorry, what?” Noah said appearing perplexed. “Dude, taxes are a responsibility, not something to evade. You’re running to be the number one citizen of a country. You shouldn’t brag about ways you found to get around the rules. You know who else found a way around the rules? OJ. No one likes him. ” Noah admitted that when the debate started, he didn’t think Trump was doing “a bad job”. “He was throwing the right punches, saying the right things,” said Noah. “But then the debate moved to foreign policy, and honestly, I was personally offended. ” Trump’s bizarre comparison of American airports to those in   countries was what eventually set Noah off. “Our airports are nicer than yours, Donald Trump,” the South African host said. “Don’t bring   countries into this shit, you hear me? Don’t involve us in your problems. ” Noah also made a point to call out Trump’s endless listing of his properties during the debate, quipping: “Donald Trump relates to America like he’s playing a game of Monopoly. ” As for Trump’s case of the sniffles, Noah suggested the Republican nominee was just “sniffing away all of the bullshit he was saying”. Colbert also weighed in on Snifflegate, joking during his segment that Trump “sounded like the   best man in the bathroom at a wedding”. Colbert kicked off his show by calling out the double standards presented by the debate. Clinton, he said, had to appear “confident but not smug, knowledgeable without being a    charming without being affected, commanding but not shrill, also likable, authoritative, warm and not coughing. Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to not commit murder  —   on camera. ” Elsewhere, Colbert deemed Clinton the better prepared of the two, dubbing her with the nickname Preparation H. “It’s a compliment!” Colbert claimed after some heckles from the audience. “In the primaries, she already proved she could soothe the Bern. ” He also drolly pointed out the debate’s first lie, showing a clip of Clinton greeting Trump graciously on stage with a “Donald, it’s good to be with you”. Lastly there was Meyers, who began by sending up the intense   to the debate. “The media hyped it like a prize fight,” said Meyers. After showing a spot that teased the debate as if it were the Super Bowl of politics, he quipped: “Based on that intro, you’d think the debate was taking place inside the UFC Octagon. ” Like Colbert, Meyers concluded that Trump appeared woefully underprepared compared to Clinton. Still, he expressed sympathy for the billionaire businessman. “His head doesn’t have room for facts and figures because it has to hold seven words,” he joked. Those words, shown in a dissection of Trump’s brain, read: Best, Huge, Ivanka, Big, Wall, Great and Tremendous.

178,"Rio 2016: Mo Farah wins 10,000m gold, USA’s Henderson wins long jump – as it happened","That’s all from me. Join us tomorrow night for coverage of the men’s 100m final, among others.    manages a smile as she’s introduced to the crowd she gets a huge cheer. Ennis Hill starts quick and is 5m ahead after 100m. Thiam is trailing at the back but we expected that. The gap between the two is around 5. 5 seconds at 400m,   still leads the filed at 600m and Thiam is fading. It will be very close, she comes home in 2:08. I think Thiam has done just enough, she gave everything at the end and found the extra second or so she needed. It was a personal best from the Belgian.    and Thiam make their way onto the track for the final race of the heptathlon 800m. A reminder that   must beat Thiam by 9. 47 seconds in order to retain her title   and that’s the difference between their personal bests.  We’re waiting until the end of the medal ceremony of the 10, 000m, in which GB’s Mo Farah will receive gold, before we start the 800m heptathlon finale. Farah looks calm on the podium   he’s been there enough. The final heat of the heptathlon 800m now, and all the contenders are in action. The reigning champion, GB’sJessica   trails Belgium’s Nafissatou Thiam by 142 points. That’s the equivalent of 9. 47 seconds   around the difference of their personal bests.   is a good 800m runner but she’ll need to be at her very best to retain her title.  If you’re wondering what’s happened in the swimming tonight, you can check out our live updates here: The 2012 champion, Britain’s Greg Rutherford, has just spoken to the BBC after a fantastic long jump competition, in which he finished third with a leap of 8. 29m, but he admits that he was “gutted” with bronze not gold. “I’m very pleased I managed to pick myself up and pull out some   jumps, the one they called a foul they gave me in the end, it’s frustrating in a competition that would probably put me back in the lead for a while,” he said. “I never thought in my career I would be disappointed with bronze but I’m gutted. ” The London 2012 gold medallist even broke down in tears before adding: “I feel like I’m in shape to jump far, and it’s frustrating when you come out of something and you don’t feel you’ve done yourself justice. I didn’t see anyone out there who was unbeatable. I was down in fourth and I’ve managed to come out and get myself a medal, but I came into the championships to win, I’m not here to finish third and it’s very very frustrating. I gave it absolutely everything I could to take it back (the gold) I felt I could but it wasn’t to be. Two Olympic medals in my career isn’t too bad, but I really wanted it tonight, I really wanted to retain that title. ” The final event of the night now. The heptathletes drag themselves to the end of the road   a road that ends with an 800m run, which doesn’t seem very fair. The first heat doesn’t contain any of the contenders for gold. USA’s   wins by a huge distance but she won’t trouble top of the podium.  Is there a more aesthetically pleasing runner on earth than Kenya’s David Rudisha? He made a blistering 1. 43. 88sec seem like a training run in the 800m   that silky long stride eating up the Rio track. Rudisha looks unstoppable, but whether he can better his 1. 40. 91 world record from London 2012 is an open question. Clayton Murphy of the US road his   and produced the run of his life with a personal best of 1. 44. 30 to qualify for the final. Looking at the replay,   was level with Thompson until the latter stages when the new champion surged away. A great burst to clinch gold.   was the first to congratulate the woman who took her crown.  USA’s Tori Bowie won silver, coming from behind,   got bronze. Thompson looks shocked   she can’t believe what she’s done.    is away the fastest   she’s been here before so little surprise she knows exactly what to do. But it’s Thompson powering through and she hits the lead around 50m and doesn’t look back. Well, she does 30m after the finish line when she realises she has an Olympic gold medal.  Williams paces a few metres down the track before taking her mark. Everyone else paces near their blocks. Who looks the most pumped up? All of them.  And the finalists are out for the women’s 100m final. A reminder of the  .    (Jam) Schippers (Ned) Bowie (USA) Ahye (TT) Ta Lou (fastest loser) (CVI) Williams (fastest loser) (Jam) Thompson (Jam) Gardner (USA) The third 800m   now. The great David Rudisha goes in this one. The Kenyan and Souleiman are one and two going into the final lap. Rudisha accelerates away in the final stretch and USA’s Clayton Murphy follows him to make the final too.  The long jump discussions keep going. It appears Lawson’s left hand hit the pit first hence his 7. 78m final jump. So Henderson is champion, South Africa’s Manyonga second and GB’s Rutherford third.  The second 800m   is up now. Kenya’s Kipketer leads from the start and takes it ahead of USA’s Boris Berian.  What will Rutherford do now? He shakes out his arms as he prepares to jump. He is known for his ability to deliver under pressure. It’s close to a foul but he gets the white flag. It’s 8. 29m   enough for a bronze with just Jarrion Lawson of USA to jump. And it looks like he may have got it! Jeff Henderson grins as we wait. The official measurement is . .. 7. 78m?! They’re going to remeasure but at the moment Henderson is the champion.  USA’s Henderson has his final jump attempting to beat 8. 37m   and it’s a big one. And it’s 8. 38m   he leads by a single centimetre! Two athletes to go, including the reigning champion Rutherford.  The men’s 800m   are next. France’s Bosse wins the first semi, with Algeria’s Taoufik Makhloufi second.  Just sensational from Mo Farah, the first British athlete ever to win three gold medals on the track. If the true test of a great athlete is how they perform on the big occasion, then Farah is right up there with the very best. In the past, his rivals have failed to take him on as a team. They did tonight, but neither they nor a tumble could stop him. The moment when he hit the front was spine tingling and the atmosphere in a now pretty full stadium did it justice. Cue the Mobot, cavorting with a Union flag and all that. Samuel Jackon is a fan of Mo Farah: South Africa’s Manyonga is in control of the long jump at the moment. He makes a mark of 8. 37m and is heading for gold. Going into the 800m of the heptathlon, Thiam has extended her lead to 142 points.   is second. The reigning champion Greg Rutherford is currently in third and produces a big jump but he fouls. Just fouls. The TV replay looks like it was fine but Rutherford inspects the plasticine and doesn’t complain   must be the smallest of fouls. Farah takes his victory lap, he looks pretty serious. Not like the euphoria of his homes Games in London. He takes the Union Jack from a member of the crowd and wraps himself in it. He’s oddly subdued for a man who is usually so exuberant.  Farah looks over his shoulder as we enter the final lap. He has a narrow lead over Tanui, and Tanui breaks. Farah goes with him in the final 100. AND HERE COMES FARAH. He accelerates to victory. He is now one of the   greats   if he wasn’t already. Others fall to the ground in agony but Farah looks fine   the adrenaline no doubt pumping. The final lap was 55sec, no one can live with his pace in the final lap. Tanui got second and Tola was third.  600m to go and Farah is still in the lead but he can’t shake Tanui.  Farah is in the lead with two laps to go. Tanui is also up with him, Galen Rupp there too.  Four laps to go. Farah still with the leading pack. But Kamworor has been dropped and looks in trouble   surprising that he’s dropped already.  South Africa’s Manyonga is now in the lead in the long jump with an attempt of 8. 28m. Jessica Ennis Hill just looked distinctly unimpressed with her final javelin attempt, clasping her hands to her head as she threw the weakest of her three attempts at 42. 17. She’s looking at taking only 784 points out of this round.  Farah into   and his friend Galen Rupp is still in the race, which could help the Briton in the final stages. Kamwowor is first   the two favourites leading the race.  Eight laps to go and the Kenyans are pushing the pace. They can’t shake Farah though   it’s the fastest lap of the night   around 63 seconds.  More on Rupp tripping Farah, from Ian Prior at the stadium: Galen Rupp looked distinctly horrified after tripping his training partner Mo Farah. The American dropped back, waited for Farah to regain his footing and then tried to pace him back to the front of the race. Farah didn’t look quite the same for a lap but is now back tracking the leaders. What has that taken out of him? The pace of the 10, 000m is   certainly not fast enough to trouble Farah for now. Remember the champion has a huge advantage if the race is close near the end due to his finishing speed. But the Kenyans are starting to push at the front. Is this a move to break Farah? We have 4, 000m to go.  Jarrion Lawson of the US produces a big jump on his third attempt. He pumps his fist as the distance comes through   he leads Rutherford with an effort of 8. 25m. Ethiopia’s Tola is setting the early front but Farah is back in fifth and doesn’t look too troubled. Galen Rupp, Farah’s friend, manages to push the Briton to the floor, accidentally but the champion is up quickly and no damage done. Who needs enemies when you have friends like these? Farah has now moved up the field after 3, 000m   the Ethiopians and Kenyans know they have to break him early as they can’t live with his pace over the final lap. Farah is trying to stay with them.  Farah continues to lope along at the back of the pack in the 10, 000m. No one has attempted to make a break yet, which will suit Farah just fine.  Greg Rutherford is back into the lead in the long jump. His jump of 8. 22m puts him narrowly ahead of the field. Jess   the reigning Olympic champion, has her first effort in the women’s javelin. It’s 45. 91m   a good effort for someone who has struggled in the discipline in the past. But Belgium’s Nafissatou Thiam blasts her effort out beyond 50m. She rubs her elbow and looks to be in pain but she may not need to throw again after an effort like that.   looks worried, and she’s right to be.

179,Experience: my family’s hypochondria saved my life,"Whenever we went on holiday, my mother always took a   kit packed with medicines, including cortisone injections, despite the fact that my father and I are only mildly allergic to bee stings. Our kitchen drawers at home in the Roman countryside resembled hospital cupboards: there were eight different aspirins from all over the world, 10 types of painkiller, bandages, antiseptic creams and adrenaline shots for the   scenarios my mother feared. I thought it was over the top, but, looking back, my family’s obsession with   saved my life. I had been taking penicillin for throat viruses from the age of four, so when the dentist prescribed antibiotics for an aching dental implant in the summer of 2006, when I was 32, I had no reason to worry. Three days later, over breakfast, I went to take one of the pills. I hadn’t even swallowed it, just put it in my mouth, when I started sneezing, scratching everywhere  —   armpits, groin, the back of my hands and feet my scalp felt as if it was on fire. I later learned that my body was rejecting the antibiotics and I had gone into anaphylactic shock. My lips started swelling  —   I looked like a grouper  —   and my dad shouted, “Oh my God!” I rushed to the mirror and saw that my lips and eyes had puffed up. I knew what was happening, and told my mum to inject me with cortisone. A week earlier, I had been out to dinner with my boyfriend and, even though he knew he is allergic to shrimps, he loves them too much not to eat them. He started to bloat like a balloon and told me to rush him to the hospital, where he was treated with a cortisone drip. Having seen his monstrous physical transformation, I recognised my own symptoms. By the time my mum injected the cortisone vial, I was slipping into darkness. My hands were shaking and I could hear my heart beating in my ears. My tongue and throat inflated, and I was suffocating. The cortisone was still working its way into my system. I have never been so scared. I clung on to my mum like a child, whispering, “I’m afraid, I’m afraid. ” I saw the terror reflected in her eyes. I passed out for a   falling on my knees and hitting my head on the cold, marble floor, which woke me up again. I opened my eyes, and it was like coming back from the grave. The cortisone had begun to work and I suddenly felt better. In the meantime, my dad had called an ambulance. A helicopter arrived, landing in a clear spot near my house. I knew I was out of danger, but the paramedics insisted on flying me to hospital. Later, the doctors explained why the reaction had been so fast and violent: I had accidentally sniffed the powdery coating of the antibiotic pill when I opened the bottle, so the penicillin entered my bloodstream through my nostrils much more quickly than it would have done if I’d ingested the pill. They said that if the cortisone hadn’t been to hand, I might have died. It took months to recover mentally. I stopped eating foods such as tomato sauce, chocolate and peanuts, scared I would react. At night, I’d wake with the feeling of suffocating. I had to see a psychiatrist, and had pharmacological tests to figure out which antibiotics I could safely take in future. Whenever I go out, I have four cortisone pills inside my purse. Doctors have told me that I am more susceptible to anaphylactic shocks than other people, and I can’t know if a substance or food will trigger one until it happens. It’s like living with a sword of Damocles over my head. I’m scared to take a simple aspirin, or of having an accident and being given antibiotics while I am unconscious. But I can laugh at it a bit, thinking about my   body transformation. And it has given me my nickname: Miss Grouper. • As told to Silvia Marchetti, • Do you have an experience to share?

180,"When it comes to character, trust your ears","I used to buy weed from a guy who I’ll call Garrett. He was one of several “unlicensed pharmacists” I dealt with in those days. He got really good, potent pot that smelled like orange peels and Christmas trees and made your scalp tingle. The trouble was that you had to hang out with Garrett to get it. He lived in a dark terrarium of a basement apartment on the east side of Athens, Georgia. White as an underground mushroom, Garrett was always in the same spot on the couch facing a pair of   TV screens he’d parked side by side so he could play video games and watch daytime TV at the same time. The apartment itself wasn’t what made hanging out with Garrett such an ordeal, or even the competing blasts of sound, light and color coming from the two TVs. It was Garrett’s voice. Garrett is the only person I’ve known in real life who has what I call “Alex Jones voice” a sound somewhere between a bleat and a wail with a   slurry of gravel underneath. And, like Jones  —   the popular conspiracy theorist, “birther” nut and   howler monkey  —   Garrett seemed to live in a perpetual state of enraged grievance. Every time I visited it was the same, and yet it was always different. In a bawling tone like a wounded calf wailing from a ditch, Garrett would recount the latest   trick his   had pulled, the staggering amounts of money our other friends owed him for weed and cocaine and pills, the way the damn neighbors’ dog barks all day when they’re at work. I would sit there with smoke trailing from my mouth and nostrils, sinking lower and lower on the slightly   leather couch as I got bludgeoned by Garrett’s voluble swings between mawkish   and heated vows of revenge. It was enervating, exhausting, overwhelming. It occurred to me one day as I paid for my quarter bag and drove   and thoroughly demoralized back to my apartment in Normaltown that people’s voices are a song that we sing about ourselves to everyone we meet. And Garretts’s song was like a bombastic “modern classical” suite for orchestra, choir and  . I believe that our minds are often processing information at levels that we’re only dimly aware of, if at all. Our ears are often smarter than we are. Look at the recent controversy that has erupted over audio tape of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging to Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush about how his fame entitles him to kiss and grope women without their consent. For months we have known that Trump is a sexist and a braggart with an interior life that most probably resembles the decimated hellscape around Hiroshima’s ground zero on the day after the blast. We’ve read court depositions about how he treated his   Ivana. We’ve shuddered over transcripts of his conversations with Sirius XM shock jock Howard Stern. However, there is something entirely different about hearing the slimy, grasping   in his tone with Bush, his smugness and complete nonchalance about women’s personal space and agency. It makes the skin crawl and has led a segment of his followers and supporters to abruptly rediscover their gag reflex. There’s a certain delicious irony in Trump’s own horrible,      voice being the final thing that shuts him up and potentially derails any last fleeting hopes that he might expand his appeal beyond his angry, frothing base. We’ve seen this before, though. After years of faint signals on the horizon that actor Mel Gibson was coming unraveled, the world was treated to a   dose of his insanity when voice mails leaked of him threatening his ex Oksana Grigorieva. That’s what ended up killing his career. It was one thing to know intellectually that he was hitting the big mental   but when we heard the viciousness with which he spoke to Grigorieva, the bullying rage in his voice, the public rejected him on a visceral level. Similarly, former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was known as a racist for decades and yet enjoyed a respectable reputation to the world at large. However, when audio leaked of Sterling castigating his girlfriend for appearing on social media with black people, the world reacted with revulsion. It was the mix of the petulance and contempt in Sterling’s wheedling, nasal rant that lit the fuse on the bomb that detonated his good standing before the world. As with Gibson and Trump, the world heard his voice and immediately remembered the   bully who tormented them, the fatuous high school   who unjustly punished them, the police officer who punched them in the face before shoving them into a squad car or the boss who made their work life a living hell. Our minds are constantly recording, measuring, analyzing. We recognize patterns and make associations. It’s how we learned to survive in this world, by keeping close track of what hurt us or made us sick in the past. Your voice is revealing more about you to the world than you realize.

181,"SEIU, one of the largest US unions, plans 30% budget cuts in wake of Trump win","The    union that was a driving force behind the Fight for $15 minimum wage protests is planning to cut its internal budgets by 30% in anticipation of the Donald Trump administration, according to an internal memo. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) president, Mary Kay Henry, has told staff that “[b]ecause the far right will control all three branches of the federal government, we will face serious threats to the ability of working people to join together in unions” and that cuts would start immediately, with a 10% budget reduction by this Saturday. News of the 14 December internal memo was first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Trump’s triumph shocked the union. In the memo, obtained by the Guardian, Henry said “the outcome of the November 2016 election results” had made a it necessary to “dramatically rethink” the SEIU’s plans for expansion. In an emailed statement, an SEIU spokeswoman, Sahar Wali, told the Guardian that the planned cuts were necessary “as we prepare to fight back against the forthcoming attacks on working people and our communities under an   government”. Wali said that SEIU was looking for “financial refinements to implement” that would best allow the SEIU to grow. “Working families are fed up with not being able to improve their families’ lives no matter how hard or how long they work while greedy corporations and   politicians continue to rig our economy and political system,” Wali wrote. Last month the SEIU president joined the New York state attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and others in denouncing Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, Andy Puzder. Puzder is the CEO of the restaurant group that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr, two   chains he has broadly criticized minimum wage increases and advocated for automating jobs currently performed by   workers. The Fight for $15 campaign has achieved success in California and New York, and it has cut into the margins of the   industry from which Puzder hails.

182,Hillary Clinton calls Trump ’temperamentally unfit’ to lead after Machado spat,"Hillary Clinton took another swipe at Donald Trump’s mental stability on Friday, declaring at a campaign stop in South Florida that the Republican nominee is “temperamentally unfit” for the White House. “Why does he do things like that?” Clinton demanded at a rally in Coral Springs, referring to Trump’s early morning   assault on former beauty queen Alicia Machado, which dominated the day’s political debate. “Who gets up at three o’clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against the former Miss Universe?” Trump sent a string of tweets between 5. 14am and 5. 30am ET, alluding to unproven accusations against Machado, who became Miss Universe in 1996 when Trump owned part of the contest and who Clinton cited in an attack regarding Trump’s treatment of women during Monday’s first presidential debate. Trump also claimed Machado, originally from Venezuela, had been helped to become a US citizen so Democrats could use her against him. “I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him,” Clinton said. “It proves, yet again, that that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and   .  “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes. ” Trump used Twitter on Friday to reply to criticism of his tweets and the hours at which they were sent by saying such nocturnal activities represented his willingness to work round the clock, writing: “For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o’clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!” By Friday evening, Trump’s false accusations that Machado had a “sex tape” had already returned to haunt him, when Buzzfeed found that Trump had a cameo in an explicit video made in 2000. A Clinton campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, told reporters: “There’s been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump. ” In two rallies in Florida, Clinton blended her attacks on Trump with new policy priorities, proposing at an earlier address in Fort Pierce a new national service reserve program for young Americans that appeared to be an attempt at winning back support among millennial voters. With recent polls showing the Democratic presidential nominee losing the confidence of voters under 30, and more than one in three planning to vote for a   candidate, Clinton offered students a pathway to paying down college debt in return for public service. “If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country,” Clinton said, touching on themes of civic responsibility and renewing a “culture of service” among Americans of all ages, as well as declaring her intention to massively expand the AmeriCorps volunteer program. “I want to find more ways for more students to get college credit for service,” she said, “because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can’t afford it. So let’s lighten that burden. ” Clinton, who was introduced in Coral Springs by a middle school civics teacher, also repeated a campaign pledge from earlier in the week, for free college tuition for children in     families. “If you are a family that makes less than $125, 000 you will not pay tuition to go to public college,” Clinton said, to cheers from a crowd of 2, 400 inside a small municipal gymnasium. “A college degree should not lead to being mired in debt. ” Students at the rally praised the new proposals. Emily Beth, 24, and Stav Berlin, 23, studying education management together at Palm Beach State College, said they were worried about taking on debt to finance their master’s degree studies in two years’ time, once their current course ends. “It’s a brilliant idea,” Berlin said. “Instead of paying back big corporations the money, we can pay it back by giving back to the community, rather than the Sallie Maes of the world that take and take and take. ” Beth, who will be voting in her second presidential election, said she liked that the volunteer work she already does tutoring children through the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach could help pay off her college loans. “This country is drowning is student debt,” she said. “It’s a brilliant idea because the paying back is in the form of community service that’s positively going to impact our entire country. ” Another student, Mia Ulrich, 18, of Pompano Beach, said she hoped to study anthropology at Florida International University in Miami, but admitted: “I’ve been worried about how I’m going to pay for school. I like the community service aspect because then I’ve given back in an active way, not only to get what I need. ” In a part of her speech that resonated with the audience, Clinton demanded answers from Iran over the fate of Bob Levinson, 68, a Coral Springs resident, former FBI agent and private investigator who disappeared in 2007. The Levinson family believes he is being held hostage by or with the knowledge of the Iranian government.  “My heart goes out to Bob’s family,” Clinton said. “It’s time for Iran’s regime to provide information about his whereabouts. ” She also mentioned the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, a popular   baseball star who was killed in a boating accident last weekend. She did not revisit a controversy from Thursday, in which her campaign seized on a Newsweek report that said Trump conducted business in contravention of the Cuba embargo in 1998. In a   address in Coral Springs, Clinton touched only briefly on several familiar policy themes, such as helping small businesses and equal pay for women. She did mentioned Monday’s first presidential debate. A   poll by   released on Friday showed her edging ahead of Trump in Florida, 46% to 42%. With 29 electoral college votes Florida is a key swing state, potentially pivotal on 8 November. Clinton promised many more visits in the 38 days left before the election.  “I’ll be here in Florida so much you’ll get sick of me,” she said at the conclusion of her speech. The Clinton campaign announced on Friday that President Obama, who won Florida by less than 75, 000 votes from Mitt Romney in 2012, will campaign in Miami next Wednesday.   Joe Biden will make appearances in Orlando and Sarasota on Monday. With the 11 October deadline for voter registration in Florida looming, Democrats are ramping up efforts to ensure a high turnout. In Broward County, of which Coral Springs is part, Clinton’s campaign has opened 10 field offices in recent weeks, to Trump’s three. Despite Broward being the “bluest” of Florida’s 67 counties, with 578, 000 registered Democrats to the 252, 000 Republicans, party strategists say every vote is crucial to counter the wide margin of victory Trump is expected to score in more rural counties, where populations are overwhelmingly white.",hillari clinton took anoth swipe donald trump mental stabil friday declar campaign stop south florida republican nomine temperament unfit white hous thing like clinton demand ralli coral spring refer trump earli morn assault former beauti queen alicia machado domin polit debat get three clock morn engag twitter attack former miss univers trump sent string tweet allud unproven accus machado becam miss univers trump own part contest clinton cite attack regard trump treatment women monday first presidenti debat trump also claim machado origin venezuela help becom citizen democrat could mean latest twitter meltdown unhing even clinton said prove temperament unfit presid said provok tweet anywher near nuclear code trump use twitter friday repli critic tweet hour sent say nocturn activ repres willing work round clock write peopl knock tweet three clock morn least know awak answer call friday even trump fals accus machado tape alreadi return haunt buzzfe found trump cameo explicit video made clinton campaign spokesman nick merril told report there talk tape today strang turn event adult film emerg today star donald trump ralli florida clinton blend attack trump polici prioriti propos earlier address fort pierc nation servic reserv program young american appear attempt win back support among millenni voter with recent poll show democrat presidenti nomine lose confid voter three plan vote candid clinton offer student pathway pay colleg debt return public servic nation servic begin program forgiv loan give back countri clinton said touch theme civic respons renew cultur servic among american age well declar intent massiv expand americorp volunt program want find way student colleg credit servic said know mani talent commit young peopl pass serv americorp student loan afford lighten burden clinton introduc coral spring middl school civic teacher also repeat campaign pledg earlier week free colleg tuition children famili famili make less tuition public colleg clinton said cheer crowd insid small municip gymnasium colleg degre lead mire debt student ralli prais propos emili beth stav berlin studi educ manag togeth palm beach state colleg said worri take debt financ master degre studi year time current cours end brilliant idea berlin said instead pay back corpor money back give back commun rather salli mae world take take take beth vote second presidenti elect said like volunt work alreadi tutor children literaci coalit palm beach could help colleg loan thi countri drown student debt said brilliant idea pay back form commun servic posit go impact entir countri anoth student ulrich pompano beach said hope studi anthropolog florida intern univers miami admit worri go school like commun servic aspect given back activ need part speech reson audienc clinton demand answer iran fate levinson coral spring resid former agent privat investig disappear levinson famili believ held hostag knowledg iranian govern heart goe famili clinton said time iran regim provid inform whereabout also mention death miami marlin pitcher fern ndez popular basebal star kill boat accid last weekend revisit controversi thursday campaign seiz newsweek report said trump conduct busi contravent cuba embargo address coral spring clinton touch briefli sever familiar polici theme help small busi equal women mention monday first presidenti debat poll releas friday show edg ahead trump florida with elector colleg vote florida swing state potenti pivot novemb clinton promis mani visit day left elect florida much sick said conclus speech clinton campaign announc friday presid obama florida less vote mitt romney campaign miami next wednesday biden make appear orlando sarasota monday with octob deadlin voter registr florida loom democrat ramp effort ensur high turnout broward counti coral spring part clinton campaign open field offic recent week trump three despit broward bluest florida counti regist democrat republican parti strategist everi vote crucial counter wide margin victori trump expect score rural counti popul overwhelmingli white
183,Barack Obama orders ’full review’ of possible Russian hacking in US election,"Barack Obama has ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after coming under sustained pressure from congressional Democrats. The review will be one of Obama’s final instructions to the intelligence agencies, which will soon report to Donald Trump, whom congressional Democrats consider the beneficiary of a hack targeting the Democratic National Committee. Lisa Monaco, the White House counterterrorism director, announced what she called a “full review” at a breakfast briefing sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday. At the White House press briefing later on Friday, Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review was “an effort to challenge the outcome of the election”.  “We have acknowledged who won the election,” he said. “It wasn’t the candidate the president campaigned for. He has gone out of his way to ensure a smooth transition of power. ” The review will span the last three presidential election cycles, Schultz told reporters. “These agencies will have to take a look at what we saw in 2008, 2012 and 2016. This is going to be a deep dive. This is a review that will be broad and deep at the same time. They’re going to look at where the activity leads them to look at. ” There were intrusions into both the Obama and John McCain campaigns in 2008, publicly attributed to the Chinese, he continued, and although there were no notable incidents in 2012, “knowing what we know now” that election will also be scrutinised.  In 2016, he said, the government did not detect any increased cyber activity on election day itself but the FBI made public specific acts in the summer and fall, tied to the highest levels of the Russian government. “This is going to put that activity in a greater context . .. dating all the way back to 2008. ” Asked if the review would investigate Russia’s motives, Schultz replied: “Malicious cyber activity, specifically malicious cyber activity tied to our elections, has no place in the international community. Unfortunately this activity is not new to Moscow. We’ve seen them do this for years . .. The president has made it clear to President Putin that this is unacceptable. ” Obama expected the review to be completed before he leaves office, Schultz said. “This is a huge priority . .. I think the president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously. This is something the president has been watching closely for eight years now. ” Schultz also told the briefing: “We’re going to make public as much as we can. As you can imagine, something like this might include sensitive and even classified information. When that report is submitted we’re going to take a look. We want to brief Congress and the relevant stakeholders, possible state directors. ” “This is good news. Declassifying and releasing information about the Russian government and the US election, and doing so quickly, must be a priority,” said Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. In October, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security publicly accused the “ ” levels of the Russian government of directing those digital breaches. Trump, who has treated Russian president Vladimir Putin with a warmth unequalled by most US politicians, has repeatedly dismissed the accusation as politically motivated. US intelligence laid the blame for the DNC hack at Russia’s feet but has not provided evidence supporting the accusation, although several private cybersecurity firms reaching the same conclusion have. Earlier this month, all the Democratic members of the Senate intelligence committee publicly intimated the administration knows significantly more about Russian culpability than the October statement revealed, and implored Obama for a public disclosure he has thus far resisted.  Yet the White House was more sympathetic to a request earlier this week from several senior Democrats in the House of Representatives, who wrote to Obama requesting a classified briefing on the role the Russians played in the election.  While Democrats, stung by a rout in an election many expected to win, have spearheaded the calls for disclosure of Russian interference, they also have some Republican support. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina hawk who savaged Trump on the campaign trail, told CNN this week he will use his Senate perch to pursue an investigation of Russian involvement in the DNC hack.  According to Monaco, the review will be classified and delivered to lawmakers before Obama leaves office on 20 January.  Democrats immediately pounced on the announced review and pressed the White House to declassify it before Trump takes office. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Russia had “succeeded” in “sow[ing] discord” in the election, and urged as much public disclosure as is possible. “More than that, the administration must begin to take steps to respond forcefully to this blatant cyber meddling, and work with our allies in Europe who have been targets of similar attacks to impose costs on the Kremlin if we do not, we can expect to see a lot more of this in the near future,” Schiff said Friday. A spokesman for the director of national intelligence declined to comment.

184,Colin Kaepernick’s critics are ignoring the target of his protest,"A few nights ago the University of Florida law professor Katheryn Russell‑Brown watched four commentators on ESPN debate Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the United States national anthem. For several minutes the men argued about whether the San Francisco 49ers quarterback was right in using the anthem to shed a light on racial inequities in their country. They spoke of soldiers away at war, veterans who died and the meaning of the US constitution. The debate raged until   finally realised the one thing they had not discussed were the issues about which Kaepernick is protesting. What happened to talking about police brutality, profiling and racial inequality, she wondered. Was not the whole reason he said he was not standing during the anthem to start a conversation about race in America? “This discussion, however, masks the fact that most of the negative responses to his protest are a reaction to the subject matter and the message of his dissent, not the form of his protest,”   said. “The people who object to his form of speech are really saying, ‘I don’t agree that these are nationally significant issues’. ” Three weeks have passed since Kaepernick first sat through the anthem before a Niners   game and the national debate is more about his choice of protest than the issues it raised. Every day brings a fresh batch of stories about who is supporting Kaepernick by kneeling or sitting through the anthem and then each of those expressions of solidarity is washed through its own news cycle. There seems almost more discussion about the former quarterback Trent Dilfer’s suggestions that Kaepernick is not fulfilling some mythical duty as backup quarterback to be silent on all matters than there is about police shootings. Critics have furthermore cloaked themselves in patriotism as a pretence to undermine Kaepernick’s voice, brushing aside his actions as a self‑serving stunt, either misguidedly or deliberately casting it as a protest against the military or, even worse, suggesting his personal fortune invalidates his perspective. Is this really what Kaepernick had in mind when he said: “I’m going to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me this is something that has to change. When there’s significant change and I feel that flag represents what it’s supposed to represent  —   this country representing people the way that it’s supposed to. ” Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African‑American studies at Duke, said: “I would argue that it’s by [Kaepernick’s] design. The flag piece is a Trojan horse. The mainstream media never really has interest in these issues until it becomes a spectacle. ” By shocking people with his anthem protest Kaepernick was getting everybody’s attention, forcing people to confront the uncomfortable issues that many people have either ignored or never understood. The issue now, is how can Kaepernick and other athletes continue to push that conversation? Will it stagnate into a daily tally of Kaepernick supporters and dissenters or can there be a new level of athlete activism? Over the years Neal has had many black athletes in his classes at Duke and he is always struck by how eloquent and thoughtful they are about race in their private work and also how reluctant they are to share those ideas in class. He senses that they have been conditioned through sports to think this way, trained by their coaches to shy away from any expressions that might detract from their athletic mission. But he also senses a new athlete activism, one started last fall when the University of Missouri football team struck in support of   students trying to change the university’s culture. The success Missouri’s players had in ousting the school’s president has shown other athletes the power of their voices. As the Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who knelt during the anthem before his team’s first   game, wrote in a first‑person essay in the Denver Post: “Now I have a tremendous platform, so when I do have conviction about these issues, I know the right thing to do to use it. ” In addition to the Missouri protest athletes have been emboldened by basketball players like LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, whose comment for the Guardian called on players to talk about social issues. But he also thinks Muhammad Ali’s death this summer awakened an awareness in many athletes. Until he died a lot of them did not know he refused to fight in the Vietnam War and was squeezed out of boxing for more than three years in the prime of his career because of it. Hearing of how he stood up to racial oppression opened their eyes. “Many of them have started to ask, how will I be judged years from now?” Neal said. Things were different in the years after Ali first spoke about race. Black athletes were emboldened to protest in those days and often did. The former NBA star Marques Johnson, who now Milwaukee Bucks games on television, remembers that his college coach at UCLA, John Wooden, had the team stay in the locker room for the national anthem because he knew most of the players would not stand for the song. “We were aware of [the anthem author] Francis Scott Key being a racist,” Johnson said. “We knew about the missing third stanza that criticises the slaves who joined the British Army so they could be free. I think we were aware of all of that. ” But something happened in the following years. The players who were moved to protest also saw how wealthy NBA stars were becoming. They noticed how Julius Erving, better known as Dr J, was celebrated for his   corporate image and they wanted to be more like him. Their zeal for protest waned. Speaking out became a sin. Once, in the early 1980s, Johnson had become so tired of hearing the media complain that the NBA was losing popularity because it did not have enough white stars, he bought a Halloween mask of a white man that he was going to wear during   before a game. Eventually he lost his nerve. He worried that it would affect his contract negotiations. Now he wonders if the current athletes have become so wealthy they feel empowered to speak out: Kaepernick, he notes, is well into a contract that guarantees him $60m. “When you have that kind of financial clout behind you those are some pretty good chips to fall back on,” he said. “But a part of that is the more financially comfortable you are means you have the means to take a stand and address some social ills. ” What’s most alarming is that many of the same voices who extolled Ali on his death in June are Kaepernick’s most strident critics. The uncomfortable truth is Ali’s   journey from White America’s most hated man to its most beloved coincided with the decline of his health. Only when he was infirm and ravaged by disease  —   when he was no longer the threat to order that he was as the handsome and virile icon of unapologetic blackness and safely removed from the present was he embraced by broader society. Martin Luther King wrote in his famous letter from Birmingham jail that it was not radicals or extremists who represented the greatest threat in the fight for justice but those whose pleas for order  —   like those angrier at Kaepernick’s actions than what it signifies  —   derailed the struggle. “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner,” he wrote, “but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action’ who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season’. ” Never have those words rung truer as the movement launched by Kaepernick struggles to take flight, nor has the mountaintop seemed further from reach. But if enough athletes continue to draw attention to the racial iniquities present in every strata in American life, they cannot be silenced forever.",night univers florida professor katheryn russel brown watch four comment espn debat colin kaepernick refus stand unit state nation anthem sever minut argu whether francisco quarterback right use anthem shed light racial inequ countri they spoke soldier away veteran die mean constitut debat rage final realis thing discuss issu kaepernick protest what happen talk polic brutal profil racial inequ wonder whole reason said stand anthem start convers race america thi discuss howev mask fact neg respons protest reaction subject matter messag dissent form protest said peopl object form speech realli say agre nation signific issu three week pass sinc kaepernick first anthem niner game nation debat choic protest issu rais everi bring fresh batch stori support kaepernick kneel sit anthem express solidar wash news cycl there seem almost discuss former quarterback trent dilfer suggest kaepernick fulfil mythic duti backup quarterback silent matter polic shoot critic furthermor cloak patriot pretenc undermin kaepernick voic brush asid action self serv stunt either misguidedli deliber cast protest militari even wors suggest person fortun invalid perspect realli kaepernick mind said go stand peopl oppress someth chang when signific chang feel flag repres suppos repres countri repres peopl suppos mark anthoni neal professor african african american studi duke said would argu kaepernick design flag piec trojan hors mainstream media never realli interest issu becom spectacl shock peopl anthem protest kaepernick get everybodi attent forc peopl confront uncomfort issu mani peopl either ignor never understood issu kaepernick athlet continu push convers will stagnat daili talli kaepernick support dissent level athlet activ over year neal mani black athlet class duke alway struck eloqu thought race privat work also reluct share idea class sens condit sport think train coach away express might detract athlet mission also sens athlet activ start last fall univers missouri footbal team struck support student tri chang univers cultur success missouri player oust school presid shown athlet power voic denver bronco lineback brandon marshal knelt anthem team first game wrote first person essay denver post tremend platform convict issu know right thing addit missouri protest athlet embolden basketbal player like lebron jame carmelo anthoni whose comment guardian call player talk social issu also think muhammad death summer awaken awar mani athlet until die know refus fight vietnam squeez box three year prime career hear stood racial oppress open eye mani start judg year neal said thing differ year first spoke race black athlet embolden protest day often former star marqu johnson milwauke buck game televis rememb colleg coach ucla john wooden team stay locker room nation anthem knew player would stand song awar anthem author franci scott racist johnson said knew miss third stanza criticis slave join british armi could free think awar someth happen follow year player move protest also wealthi star becom they notic juliu erv better known celebr corpor imag want like their zeal protest wane speak becam onc earli johnson becom tire hear media complain lose popular enough white star bought halloween mask white go wear game eventu lost nerv worri would affect contract negoti wonder current athlet becom wealthi feel empow speak kaepernick note well contract guarante when kind financi clout behind pretti good chip fall back said part financi comfort mean mean take stand address social ill what alarm mani voic extol death june kaepernick strident critic uncomfort truth journey white america hate belov coincid declin health onli infirm ravag diseas longer threat order handsom viril icon unapologet black safe remov present embrac broader societi martin luther king wrote famou letter birmingham jail radic extremist repres greatest threat fight justic whose plea order like angrier kaepernick action signifi derail struggl almost reach regrett conclus negro great stumbl block stride toward freedom white citizen council klux klanner wrote white moder devot order justic prefer neg peac absenc tension posit peac presenc justic constantli say agre goal seek agre method direct action paternalist feel timet anoth freedom live mythic concept time constantli advis negro wait conveni season never word rung truer movement launch kaepernick struggl take flight mountaintop seem reach enough athlet continu draw attent racial iniqu present everi strata american life cannot silenc forev
185,Iceland Airwaves festival day four – Björk’s the star in her home country,"Iceland Airwaves may not have the AR reputation of South by South West or CMJ, but it does offer as wide a variety of new music as any festival, both local and international (with an obvious focus on Icelandic and Scandinavian talent). And the bookers deserve a mention because they’ve ensured that wherever you alight, at whichever of the dozen or so venues in town (with a couple on the outskirts) you’re bound to find something of interest. You could almost see it as a festival made in the image of the nation’s totemic individualist and experimentalist, Björk. Saturday is virtually a showcase for potential Björk collaborators. There is Bára Gísladóttir, an Icelandic composer and double bassist who has performed with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and isa member of the   composers’ collective Errata. Her performance is both arthouse  —   a woman sawing away at her instrument with little attention paid to such niceties as accessibility and melody  —   and thrilling. She does to the double bass what Hendrix did to the electric guitar, using it to coax out thrillingly strange new sounds. There is a laptop, too, so it’s hard to ascertain precisely the provenance of all those faintly disturbing noises, but in one song alone they variously approximate the creak of a door in a haunted house and the wheeze of a pensioner gasping for breath. Equally far out on the lunatic fringe is Hermigervill, a quirky, bearded gentleman who employs a mix of analogue gadgetry andcomputers. At one point he hovers his hand over what sounds like a Stylophone and, without actually touching it, gets it to play: think Uri Geller meets the Aphex Twin. But it’snot all novelty trickery. One of his songs, Thorparinn, is fantastic throbbing instrumental disco, a distant cousin of Space’s Magic Fly. When he invites onstage another bearded chap in an equally unflattering   jumper to sing over one of his tunes, it’s like attending a rave put on by two Open University professors from 1975. He ends his set with a track that is equal parts dub and technopop, like Yello stuck in a Swiss studio with King Tubby. Björk would love surely love Kelsey Lu, an   from North Carolina who has worked with Blood Orange, Kelela, Wet and Organized Noize. Her debut EP, Church, was recorded live in Brooklyn’s Holy Roman Catholic Church and she immediately creates a hushed, reverent atmosphere somewhere between a conservatoire and a cathedral. Sh estands on a fur rug and, in the     uses her instrument, and a loop pedal, to create chamber pop backdrops for her gorgeous voice. She seems vulnerable and troubled, singing about “broken promises”  —   standard   tropes, perhaps, but afforded a new potency in these startling contexts. She sings a song about her late grandmother who struggled with Alzheimers and, eavesdropping on this moment of private grief, it is unspeakably plaintive. SG Lewis, a labelmate of Disclosure and Jessie Ware, is the perfect act for the midnight hour with his luscious dance music and (not a contradiction in terms, this) soulful,    . There’s a real live drummer, someone   the warm sound of a Rhodes piano on a keyboard, and Lewis himself straps on a bass at one point for a set that gives commercial dance music a good name. Gunnar Jónsson Collider blends ambient electronica and   drones, joining the dots between two different eras of psychedelic exploration. There are lots of people sitting down for his set, but it’s not all stoned abstraction for supine satisfaction. Flanked by a guitarist and drummer, he plays one song that is quite catchy in a shoegaze way.  In Valshöllin, an aircraft hangar on the edge of town, Denmark’s Emil Stabil and his hype man do their level best to whip up a sparse crowd. Their uniformly slow   reflects the pace of the American variety, and that’s OK, but it would be nice, especially given the parlous state of the planet, to have some urgent radical rap right now produced by a 21st century Bomb Squad. Reykjavik’s Þriðja Hæðin, a   throwback who come onstage to LL Cool J’s Mama Said Knock You Out, bring some cartoon energy to their performance.  To judge by the buzz on the bus to the venue, you’d think Odd Future were about to break, not fast becoming a distant memory. Odd Future offshoot the Internet capitalise on that good feeling, preparing to party like it’s 2009 with their musicianly take on modern RB  —   machines are kept to a minimum, the jazzy chords and subtle rhythms courtesy of players who appear to worship at the altar of 70s and 80s soul, the   machine variety. With her   and outsize workshirt, Syd tha Kyd subverts the soul lothario persona (Ego Death, the Internet’s latest album, is virtually a gay Let’s Get It On) but her voice is as sweet as, say, Kelela’s or indeed any of the new RB starlets, from Tink to Tinashe. Back at the Harpa concert hall, Let’s Eat Grandma acquit themselves well before a big crowd, with their intimations of ritual and pagan strangeness. In their matching shiny black trouser suits with silver snake designs, they evoke the magic and mystery of childhood and remind you that, for primal reasons unknown, the sight of   young females standing together can be more than a little unsettling. Epic Rain are a local   featuring harp, double bass and other instrumentation used in the service of their odd mixture of   languid lounge noir and dark cabaret. Over spaghetti   guitar, their tattooed rapper, Bragi, sounds like Tom Waits doing an impression of Lee Van Cleef as sepia images of Iceland appear on the screen behind the stage.   ethereal electronic RB outfit Gangly suggest the xx (and the Weeknd, and James Blake) should be on some sort of commission points system. Björk actually kicked things off on Saturday, at 5pm, with her show of two halves: one set of orchestrated reworkings of her 2015 album Vulnicura, and a second set of   “hits”. For the first she wore a red puffy dress and matching shoes and headdress, but really the mood was blue, although Vulnicura is an autopsy of her relationship with Matthew Barney, so maybe the colour did make sense. This was   Björk, singing sweetly these sometimes sour scenes from a marriage, the alternately swelling and stabbing strings and weeping violins conjuring mournfulness and melodrama. It is to her credit that she managed to make Vulnicura  —   her Blood on the Tracks if not her Berlin or Sister Lovers  —   a viable commercial attraction, giving shape and order to the emotional tumult, to these snippets of words said in anger (“You betrayed your own heart   corrupted that organ”) and anguished cries about the destruction of a family. She created intimacy in an immense space. After the interval, the mood was lightened somewhat as Björk returned for renditions of Jóga and Bachelorette, for which she wore what looked like an extraterrestrial burka. Of course she did. Shame she couldn’t have caught Dream Wife, who were offering similar insights into the rules and roles of relationships in an upstairs bar on the other side of town. Variously from Reykjavik, London and Brighton, a riot of   hair and   gear, these three grrrls (and token drummerbloke) in a set made to look like a kitsch retro lounge, were all sound and fury signifying loathing for the patriarchy  —   and suddenly, with events unfolding in the States, the stakes have been raised and such sentiments have renewed relevancy. On F. U. U. Dream Wife chanted, “Gonna fuck you up, gonna cut you up,” teasing out the nastiness, relishing the taste of the inflicted pain. The joy on their faces was unconfined.

186,RG3’s recklessness may have cost him the last great chance of his career,"If there was a play that said everything about what Robert Griffin III’s career would become, it was one the block he threw in the shadows of his first NFL game, far from the cameras and prying eyes in the stands. Few in the New Orleans Superdome that day in September 2012 noticed when Washington’s new quarterback inexplicably ran ahead of   Alfred Morris and knocked the Saints’ Roman Harper to the ground. But it should have been warning for the weeks and years to come. And for a football life that might be finished. Only Griffin couldn’t understand that at the time. “Cut him,” he said after the game, still beaming at the memory. He and Harper tussled after the play. Quarterbacks don’t block safeties in the NFL and Harper didn’t care much for Griffin’s hit. They had words in that     way that football players do, and then RG3 went back to the congratulations of his new teammates. “It shows he’s a football player,” Washington linebacker London Fletcher said that day. “That block shows he’s willing to sacrifice himself for the team. ” But it was also an alarming sign of a disaster to come. While RG3’s plunging knockdown of Harper might have sent hearts thumping on the Washington bench, it showed a recklessness, a need to prove his toughness through the kind of contact a quarterback should not want. It was the kind of thing he could never eliminate from his game, despite the pleas of too many coaches. Now it may have cost him the last great chance of his career. On Monday, the Cleveland Browns placed Griffin on injured reserve after he broke a bone in his   shoulder on a play late in the team’s   loss at Philadelphia. This means he will be out at least eight weeks and with Cleveland already looking to the future, his chances of playing for the Browns again are slim. If this really is the end for RG3, he will be finished not for his exuberance, or his struggles to master a   game, but rather his refusal to keep from getting hit. His brief NFL run has been filled with blows that have bent his knee, ripped ligaments and shaken his brain. Each time his coaches screamed that he needed to slide away from tackles or dash out of bounds. They said he wasn’t built like Cam Newton or Colin Kaepernick. They told him his wiry, hurdler’s frame wasn’t made to take football contact game after game. Each time he nodded and said he understood. Then he’d go in a game and get himself hit again. Who knows why he never changed. Maybe he couldn’t. Maybe he had built himself into so much of a running and passing sensation at Baylor, winning the 2011 Heisman Trophy, that he couldn’t be anything else. His speed got him though college and made him the NFL’s rookie of the year in 2012. Perhaps running was all he knew and no level of good sense was going to teach him otherwise. Lord knows everyone tried. After he tore his ACL in college, his father attempted to change him, propping him on a stool with his bandaged leg in a parking lot and ordering him to throw pass after pass to build his arm strength. In Washington, his first coach, Mike Shanahan, begged him to be more like the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson, who is masterful at dodging contact. His next coach at Washington, Jay Gruden, asked the same thing. As did Hue Jackson in Cleveland. Their pleas never worked. Griffin kept taking the shots. Sunday’s hit was like so many of the others in his past. RG3 had taken off running, trying to stretch for extra yards, when he ran straight into Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills, who met Griffin’s shoulder with his own. When they got back up, it was Griffin’s shoulder, not Mills’s that dangled limply from under his pads. Ironically, Mills is a rookie from LSU, playing his college football just an hour from New Orleans, where Griffin made that block the first day of his career. Maybe it is fitting that a player from Louisiana might be the one to finish Griffin’s time in the NFL. It will be sad if this is the end for Griffin. Few NFL players have ever been as interesting or willing to share themselves with the public. He might have confounded many because he never fit a stereotype for an NFL quarterback both on the field and off, but that was also his charm: he was not a football robot. He couldn’t do the one thing he had to, however. He couldn’t avoid a hit. From that first block in New Orleans to that last blow in Philadelphia, he kept getting himself knocked to the turf. Why couldn’t he listen to good advice when it was given? Before it was too late?

187,Donald Trump will violate the US constitution on inauguration day,"When Donald Trump swears at the inauguration that he will “faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States” he will be committing a violation of constitutional magnitude.  The US constitution flatly prohibits any “Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States]” from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State”.  Known as the emoluments clause, this provision was designed on the theory that a federal officeholder who receives something of value from a foreign power can be tempted to compromise what the constitution insists be his exclusive loyalty: the best interest of the United States. The clause applies to the president and covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions with foreign states and their agents that result in any profit or benefit. That a hostile government has gotten its money’s worth from our president is obviously no defense to a charge that he has abused his office.   Trump’s continued interest in the Trump Organization and his steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers put him on a collision course with the emoluments clause. Disentangling every improper influence resulting from special treatment of Trump’s business holdings by foreign states would be impossible. The American people would be condemned to uncertainty, leaving our political discourse rife with accusations of corruption. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that Trump has regularly declined to make his business dealings or tax returns transparent. Thus a specter of skewed incentives will haunt a Donald Trump presidency.  While much has changed since the constitution was written, certain premises of politics and human nature have held steady. Among them is that private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 22: “One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption. ” The framers sought to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings, writing a broad ban on potentially corrupting foreign influence into article I of our nation’s charter. By imposing clear limitations, the clause avoids situations in which the American people must search for hints of improperly motivated presidential favoritism toward selected foreign powers, or of foreign attempts to seduce the American president into compromising our national interest for his private profit.   With Trump, this search has already begun. His global business empire creates ideal conditions for ongoing violations of the emoluments clause. Mere weeks before Trump spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan  —   a dramatic departure from America’s “one China” policy  —   a businesswoman associated with his conglomerate reportedly arrived in Taiwan to inquire about major new investments in luxury hotels. Trump’s businesses owe hundreds of millions to Deutsche Bank, which is currently negotiating a   settlement with the US Department of Justice  —   a settlement that will now be overseen by an attorney general selected by and serving at the pleasure of Trump.  In his last public press conference, Trump called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her personal emails. Recently, both the FBI and CIA determined that the highest levels of Russia’s government in fact ran a covert operation aimed at helping Trump’s campaign, making his victory in the electoral college more likely.  The bottom line is simple: Trump stands to benefit personally, in innumerable and largely hidden ways, from decisions made daily by foreign governments and their agents. History teaches that leaders with divided interests cannot be counted on to faithfully serve those who elected them.  The framers understood this lesson. The emoluments clause was forged of their   wisdom. No relic of a bygone era, it is a profound expression of insight into the nature of the human condition and the preconditions of sovereign  .  Trump’s shifting proposals for addressing his multifarious conflicts of interests are simply inadequate. If he retains an ownership interest in his empire, his personal bottom line is necessarily affected by everything his business does, whether or not he is at the helm. Nor is a supposedly “blind trust” involving control of Trump’s assets by his adult children remotely sufficient. It is inconceivable that he could avoid discussing with them at least some matters relating to his policies and their business ventures, or that he could avoid noticing and caring about their interactions with foreign nations.  So even full divestment of his personal ownership and control of the Trump Organization is no remedy for his emoluments clause violation: it is often to the prince and not the king that special favors are done.  Because Trump would take office in blatant violation of the constitution, the electoral college would be fully justified in concluding that he is unsuited to the presidency. As Justice Robert Jackson wrote 64 years ago, electors must be considered free to vote their conscience.  If Trump deliberately declines to cure his continuing violation of the emoluments clause upon entering office, Congress has both power and responsibility to enforce the constitution. It would be well within its rights to impeach and remove him for engaging in “high crimes and misdemeanors”.  Short of that awesome step, Congress might set lasting, bipartisan precedent by requiring all presidents to divest assets that risk conflicts of interest and to place the proceeds in a truly blind trust, and by creating a private cause of action explicitly allowing competitors disadvantaged by the president’s acceptance of unlawful benefits to file emoluments clause suits against the president in his personal capacity.  The looming constitutional shadow cast by a Trump presidency poses a frightening risk to our national security and gravely disserves the people of the United States.",when donald trump swear inaugur faith execut offic presid unit state best abil preserv protect defend constitut unit state commit violat constitut magnitud constitut flatli prohibit person hold offic profit trust unit state accept present emolu offic titl kind whatev king princ foreign state known emolu claus provis design theori feder officehold receiv someth valu foreign power tempt compromis constitut insist exclus loyalti best interest unit state claus appli presid cover even ordinari fair market valu transact foreign state agent result profit benefit that hostil govern gotten money worth presid obvious defens charg abus offic trump continu interest trump organ steadi stream monetari benefit foreign power collis cours emolu claus disentangl everi improp influenc result special treatment trump busi hold foreign state would imposs american peopl would condemn uncertainti leav polit discours rife accus corrupt these problem exacerb fact trump regularli declin make busi deal return transpar thu specter skew incent haunt donald trump presid while much chang sinc constitut written certain premis polit human natur held steadi among privat financi interest subtli sway even virtuou leader alexand hamilton wrote federalist weak side republ among numer advantag afford easi inlet foreign corrupt framer sought avoid end avoid begin write broad potenti corrupt foreign influenc articl nation charter impos clear limit claus avoid situat american peopl must search hint improperli motiv presidenti favorit toward select foreign power foreign attempt seduc american presid compromis nation interest privat profit with trump search alreadi begun global busi empir creat ideal condit ongo violat emolu claus mere week trump spoke phone presid taiwan dramat departur america china polici businesswoman associ conglomer reportedli arriv taiwan inquir major invest luxuri hotel trump busi hundr million deutsch bank current negoti settlement depart justic settlement overseen attorney gener select serv pleasur trump last public press confer trump call russia hack hillari clinton releas person email recent determin highest level russia govern fact covert oper aim help trump campaign make victori elector colleg like bottom line simpl trump stand benefit person innumer larg hidden way decis made daili foreign govern agent histori teach leader divid interest cannot count faith serv elect framer understood lesson emolu claus forg wisdom relic bygon profound express insight natur human condit precondit sovereign trump shift propos address multifari conflict interest simpli inadequ retain ownership interest empir person bottom line necessarili affect everyth busi whether helm supposedli blind trust involv control trump asset adult children remot suffici inconceiv could avoid discuss least matter relat polici busi ventur could avoid notic care interact foreign nation even full divest person ownership control trump organ remedi emolu claus violat often princ king special favor done becaus trump would take offic blatant violat constitut elector colleg would fulli justifi conclud unsuit presid justic robert jackson wrote year elector must consid free vote conscienc trump deliber declin cure continu violat emolu claus upon enter offic congress power respons enforc constitut would well within right impeach remov engag high crime misdemeanor short awesom step congress might last bipartisan preced requir presid divest asset risk conflict interest place proce truli blind trust creat privat caus action explicitli allow competitor disadvantag presid accept unlaw benefit file emolu claus suit presid person capac loom constitut shadow cast trump presid pose frighten risk nation secur grave disserv peopl unit state
188,Bikers for Trump at Republican national convention: ’We’re part of a movement’,"David is worried about my ability to knock him out, despite the fact he’s carrying a loaded pistol holstered to his belt. “If you were a bad guy right now and you wanted to punch me in the mouth and knock me out with the   ‘knock out game’  —   who’s there to do anything about it for me?” he says, striding toward a large rally supported by his organization, Bikers for Trump, a   vigilante collective of veterans and law enforcement supporters from across America.  Although Cleveland is the most fortified city in America at the moment, with thousands of police, FBI and secret service agents securing the Republican national convention, David  —   who won’t give me his last name but says he is from Minnesota  —   worries about “agitators” and “thugs” who make him feel unsafe. “We [Bikers for Trump] protect the police as much as the police protect us,” he claims.  But many officers in Cleveland would likely disagree with David’s assessment. On Sunday, following the fatal shooting of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the head of the city’s largest police union, Steve Loomis, called on Ohio governor John Kasich to temporarily rescind the right to open carry in the city, arguing those who did jeopardized the safety of officers.  “It’s irresponsible of those folks  —   especially right now  —   to be coming downtown with open carry AR [assault rifle]s or anything else. I couldn’t care less if it’s legal or not,” Loomis said.  Following the deaths of five police officers at a protest march in Dallas earlier in the month, local officials expressed frustration that up to 20 marchers had open carried during the protest, leading to widespread confusion during the massacre over how many people had opened fire. For Bob Posatiere Sr, 61, another Bikers for Trump member and a former Cleveland Metro Park police officer, this frustration should never supersede a constitutional right to carry.  “If that’s our right, that’s our right,” he says, after pointing out that his pistol is holstered out of sight for discretion, and saying it will protect me and him from any unseen threats at this peaceful rally.  Fear of the unknown is a common theme at this very white, very male Citizens for Trump rally, organized by the former Nixon adviser and Trump strategist Roger Stone.  Alex Jones, the noted conspiracy theorist and operator of the Infowars website, repeatedly condemns the “liberal media” without really articulating what he means. He accuses Hillary Clinton of being a “foreign agent” for the Chinese and Saudi Arabian government, without citing anything close to evidence.  “We’re sick and tired of what we’ve been seeing, that’s why we want Donald Trump,” Jones screams, as members of the crowd call out that Clinton is a “reptile” and a “bitch” and chant “Hillary for Prison”. “It’s powerful, it’s exhilarating,” says Daryl Rembowski, a    Bikers for Trump member from Cleveland. “He [Jones] is a true American. He stands for truth and he’s exposing the lies. ”  He adds: “We’re part of a movement, yeah. This is definitely making history. ”  While the threats may not be visible here, and police arrested just one person on Monday in connection with protests at the RNC, many Bikers for Trump members speaking to the Guardian pointed to one particular group, Black Lives Matter, as a tangible example of the need to remain vigilant.  Despite leaders of the movement, who are credited with igniting a new civil rights movement throughout the US, repeatedly denouncing violence, various Bikers for Trump members described the nebulous organization as a “terrorist threat” and a “hostile group”.  None had time for the argument, frequently articulated since the fatal police shooting of African American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that state violence in America is disproportionately meted out to black people.  “I don’t know why you people think that cops wake up one day and say ‘well I’m going to shoot somebody’,” says    Dave Lenley, who rode all the way from London, Kentucky. “Do you realize that ruins that person’s life? Aside from the one that got killed, that officer’s life has been ruined, whether he’s black, white, Hispanic or what. They [officers] don’t wake up one day and say: ‘I think I’m going to shoot me black person. ’”  Had Lenley seen the video of unarmed African American Walter Scott, shot five times from behind as he ran away from white North Charleston officer Michael Slager?  Yes, Lenley said, but added: “Why was he running away? The police officer told him to stop. If I tell you to stop, stop. ”",david worri abil knock despit fact carri load pistol holster belt right want punch mouth knock knock game anyth say stride toward larg ralli support organ biker trump vigilant collect veteran enforc support across america although cleveland fortifi citi america moment thousand polic secret servic agent secur republican nation convent david give last name say minnesota worri agit thug make feel unsaf biker trump protect polic much polic protect claim mani offic cleveland would like disagre david assess sunday follow fatal shoot three enforc offic baton roug louisiana head citi largest polic union steve loomi call ohio governor john kasich temporarili rescind right open carri citi argu jeopard safeti offic irrespons folk especi right come downtown open carri assault rifl anyth els care less legal loomi said follow death five polic offic protest march dalla earlier month local offici express frustrat marcher open carri protest lead widespread confus massacr mani peopl open fire posatier anoth biker trump member former cleveland metro park polic offic frustrat never supersed constitut right carri right right say point pistol holster sight discret say protect unseen threat peac ralli fear unknown common theme white male citizen trump ralli organ former nixon advis trump strategist roger stone alex jone note conspiraci theorist oper infowar websit repeatedli condemn liber media without realli articul mean accus hillari clinton foreign agent chines saudi arabian govern without cite anyth close evid sick tire see want donald trump jone scream member crowd call clinton reptil bitch chant hillari prison power exhilar say daryl rembowski biker trump member cleveland jone true american stand truth expos lie add part movement yeah thi definit make histori while threat visibl polic arrest person monday connect protest mani biker trump member speak guardian point particular group black live matter tangibl exampl need remain vigil despit leader movement credit ignit civil right movement throughout repeatedli denounc violenc variou biker trump member describ nebul organ terrorist threat hostil group none time argument frequent articul sinc fatal polic shoot african american teenag michael brown ferguson missouri state violenc america disproportion mete black peopl know peopl think cop wake well go shoot somebodi say dave lenley rode london kentucki realiz ruin person life asid kill offic life ruin whether black white hispan they offic wake think go shoot black person lenley seen video unarm african american walter scott shot five time behind away white north charleston offic michael slager lenley said ad run away polic offic told stop tell stop stop
189,"’We are protectors, not protesters’: why I’m fighting the North Dakota pipeline","Our elders have told us that if the zuzeca sape, the black snake, comes across our land, our world will end. Zuzeca has come  —   in the form of the Dakota Access pipeline  —   and so I must fight. I am   Lakota, born in Rosebud, South Dakota, and writing from the frontline of the movement against the pipeline in Cannon Ball. I have been holding this ground with my Standing Rock Sioux tribe relatives since the spring. I am defending the land and water of my people, as my ancestors did before me. The $3. 8bn pipeline project is proposed to carry approximately 470, 000 barrels per day of fracked oil from our Bakken oil fields, 1, 172 miles through the country’s heartland, to Illinois. The pipeline will cross the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers, where it threatens to contaminate our primary source of drinking water and damage the bordering Indigenous burial grounds, historic villages and sundance sites that surround the area in all directions. Those sites that were not desecrated when the area was flooded in 1948 by the construction of the Oahe dam are now in danger again. This week, I have witnessed pipeline construction tear its way toward the waters of the Missouri river which flow into the Mississippi, threatening to pollute the aquifer that carries drinking water to 10 million people. I have seen where their machines clawed through the earth that once held my relatives’ villages. I have watched law enforcement officials protect the oil industry by dragging away my indigenous brothers and sisters who stood up for our people. The fact that Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, would use the word “Dakota” which means “friend” or “ally” in the name of its project is disrespectful. This pipeline is a direct threat to all Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people, especially our future generations. And we are not the only ones. We know that burning this oil is changing our climate and Indigenous people all over the world are bearing the brunt of the catastrophes that causes. This pipeline poses threats strikingly similar to those posed by the now defeated Keystone XL, but has received a fraction of the attention from mainstream media and big environmental groups. On 26 July, we were surprised to learn that the North Dakota permits were approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers to run the pipeline within a   of our reservation. My tribal leaders have said that this done without consulting tribal governments, and without a meaningful study of the impacts it will have. This is a violation of federal law and, more importantly, of our treaties with the US government  —   the supreme law of the land. It was my Ina, my mother, who first told me of this struggle. With my Ina, ciye (older brother) and tunwin (aunt) we have joined our Standing Rock relatives to face this new storm. For the past month, we have stood with Standing Rock in solidarity, we have prayed, we have cried, and we have also laughed, even when we thought it impossible to do so. I never thought I would be on the frontline of a fight like this. I grew up admiring Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and my ancestor American Horse, for their courage and leadership in battle against their oppressors. Now I am fighting alongside their descendants, my relatives from all seven tribes, against the very same oppressors.  It saddens me that the government time and time again continues to ravage my people with the same treatment and attitude, only different weapons. But why should be surprised? This is the definition of insanity  —   to go through the same situations over and over believing the outcome will be different. This camp was created as a last defense for the water that our communities depend on to survive. I have watched our numbers dwindle down to the single digits, and now we have swelled to over 300 people in just a few days. Hundreds more are on the way right now, as other tribes gather resources to send people and supplies. This historic battle is bringing the Oceti Sakowin together like nothing has ever before. The Hunkpapa, the tribal band of Standing Rock, are now joined by the Oglala from Pine Ridge, the Sicangu from Rosebud, and relatives from Crow Creek, Cheyenne River, and Yankton, as well as Dine and Ponca relatives from the south, Ojibwe relatives from the Great Lakes, and countless others. From all across the country, tribes are bringing us shelter, food and most importantly, prayers. To have all this unity of tribes standing together in solidarity before my eyes is a beautiful sight.

190,Thunder play ugly brilliantly as they shock Warriors in conference finals,"This year’s NBA playoffs have found their villain now, thumping into the title holders with frosty glares. The Oklahoma City Thunder became the bad guys of the postseason when they broke up what was probably Tim Duncan’s last championship run. And now they are trying to ruin the Golden State Warriors’ joy. OKC swaggered onto the Warriors floor Monday night no longer the young, happy team of a few years back but gruff outsiders scarred by disappointments and looking to stomp on sunshine. There’s nothing fun about this Oklahoma City team. Almost an afterthought in Steph Curry’s Western Conference, the Thunder have remade themselves as a rugged spoiler of pretty basketball, ready to shove, elbow or wrestle their way to a victory. This is what makes them the most serious threat to the Warriors’ dance to a second straight title. They lug with them a world of resentment with nothing to lose    —   a lethal combination in playoff basketball. “I mean we hear it all the time, defense wins games,” Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant said in a leaden, passionless voice after the Thunder’s   victory over the Warriors in the first conference final game. The team that was supposed to be the Warriors’ latest victim on their march to the next title will not go quietly. All those beautiful passes, skipping shots and delicate player movements that dazzled the NBA this season do not impress a core of Oklahoma City players all these years on. The Thunder use words like “resilient” and “focus,” which usually fill the dreary, heavy talk of a team that looks at the playoffs as a long, tedious slog of games to be endured rather than won. In Game 1 they forced Golden State to rush perfection. Their aggressive lunges at the ball forced the Warriors out of the precise and delicate pace. Passes were thrown a foot too far, shots were an inch too far to the left or right. The Warriors didn’t miss by much. But all the Thunder needed to turn a Golden State party into a   war was nudge Curry (26 points on the night) and Klay Thompson (25) to shoot a couple of seconds too soon and from just the wrong angle. The Golden State machine broke down after that. They are the antidote to the effortless brilliance that has been Golden State for nearly these last two seasons. If they are going to win they will win ugly and this is something they are more than fine with. That determination was never more obvious than in the fourth quarter as they fought their way to victory   at one point in the game they had been 14 points down to the Warriors. Durant picked up 26 points, including a crucial jumper with 30 seconds left, and Russell Westbrook scored 24 of his 27 in the second half. “I mean what’s to celebrate?” Durant said of his team’s dour look after what should have been a momentous victory. “We didn’t win the championship. ” He did not smile. Once the Thunder were the Warriors. Once Durant was Curry, a player who played as if he loved every minute he was on the court. Durant wore backpacks to his postgame press conferences and Westbrook had the funny suits. They were everybody’s darlings, the team the world wanted badly to win back. Late on Monday night, long after Curry had dressed and left the arena, Durant lingered in the hall outside the Thunder locker room. He had on ripped jeans and a denim jacket. He didn’t wear a backpack. He didn’t look young and happy. He waited impatiently for Westbrook who was several steps behind and looked less like a fashion icon and more like someone out to walk the dog in an oversized orange sweatshirt. The Thunder have grown up into something far less fun but far more dangerous. They are forgotten and experienced and they know just how to make the Splash Brothers struggle to make everything look easy. Defense wins games. Who knew years ago this would become the mantra of Westbrook and Durant? But if they are to ever win a title together that is the stand they have to take. They never could win everything by being pretty but they might just take it all by playing ugly. The new Thunder will never be as loveable as the boundless Warriors who skip passes through games with a splendid ease that can resemble a   soccer team.  “They didn’t make many mistakes on the defensive end which forced us into bad shots,” Curry said. “Offensively we sucked,” Golden State’s Draymond Green said. This was, of course, but just one game of a long series and the shots Curry took that looked dumb on Monday would have been brilliant had they fallen. He has a way of turning shots that no one should take into works of art. If two of those attempts that clunked of the rim and instead swished through the net we would be talking about another chapter in the   Curry story. But he didn’t make them and with seven turnovers, many on sloppy pass attempts over the Thunder’s formidable front court he fell into the trap set by the new Thunder, the one that will try to grind their way to a championship. In two weeks they have beaten the Spurs and the Warriors three times on their home courts which is as many times as San Antonio and Golden State lost at home all season. After years of despair they have learned to deliver despair to others. Suddenly there is a threat to the Warriors. Few saw the Thunder coming.",thi year playoff found villain thump titl holder frosti glare oklahoma citi thunder becam guy postseason broke probabl duncan last championship tri ruin golden state warrior swagger onto warrior floor monday night longer young happi team year back gruff outsid scar disappoint look stomp sunshin there noth oklahoma citi team almost afterthought steph curri western confer thunder remad rug spoiler pretti basketbal readi shove elbow wrestl victori thi make seriou threat warrior danc second straight titl they world resent noth lose lethal combin playoff basketbal mean hear time defens win game oklahoma citi forward kevin durant said leaden passionless voic thunder victori warrior first confer final game team suppos warrior latest victim march next titl quietli beauti pass skip shot delic player movement dazzl season impress core oklahoma citi player year thunder word like resili focu usual fill dreari heavi talk team look playoff long tediou slog game endur rather game forc golden state rush perfect their aggress lung ball forc warrior precis delic pace pass thrown foot shot inch left right warrior miss much thunder need turn golden state parti nudg curri point night klay thompson shoot coupl second soon wrong angl golden state machin broke they antidot effortless brillianc golden state nearli last season go ugli someth fine that determin never obviou fourth quarter fought victori point game point warrior durant pick point includ crucial jumper second left russel westbrook score second half mean celebr durant said team dour look moment victori championship smile onc thunder warrior onc durant curri player play love everi minut court durant wore backpack postgam press confer westbrook funni suit they everybodi darl team world want badli back late monday night long curri dress left arena durant linger hall outsid thunder locker room rip jean denim jacket wear backpack look young happi wait impati westbrook sever step behind look less like fashion icon like someon walk overs orang sweatshirt thunder grown someth less danger they forgotten experienc know make splash brother struggl make everyth look easi defens win game knew year would becom mantra westbrook durant ever titl togeth stand take they never could everyth pretti might take play ugli thunder never loveabl boundless warrior skip pass game splendid eas resembl soccer team they make mani mistak defens forc shot curri said offens suck golden state draymond green said thi cours game long seri shot curri took look dumb monday would brilliant fallen turn shot take work attempt clunk instead swish would talk anoth chapter curri stori make seven turnov mani sloppi pass attempt thunder formid front court fell trap thunder grind championship week beaten spur warrior three time home court mani time antonio golden state lost home season after year despair learn deliv despair other suddenli threat warrior thunder come
191,What kind of president will Trump be? His erratic transition keeps us guessing,"Fresh from his Thanksgiving Florida break, Donald Trump is due to finalise his cabinet in the coming days in an unconventional presidential transition that has kept supporters and critics alike in suspense as to the true nature of his administration. The   has so far adopted a pick’n’mix approach to his appointments, embracing both loyalists and rivals, both career politicians and outsiders with little salient experience. He has similarly been a shape shifter on policy, tempering numerous campaign promises and spitting out random ideas, such as his undiplomatic proposal that Nigel Farage become British ambassador to the US. Observers are asking: will the real Donald Trump please stand up? The one who will be president, that is? “I guess it all depends which President Trump shows up in the oval office,” said Leon Panetta, former defence secretary and head of the CIA. “If it’s the Trump who’s made some irresponsible statements about foreign policy and things we ought to be doing, obviously that would be cause for concern. “If it’s the more responsible President Trump, the guy who gave a pretty good election night speech and had a good meeting with President Obama, if it’s the businessman Trump who’s interested in working with good people and cutting deals and trying to serve the best interests of the county, then it could be a different Trump. I think we’ll get a test of that not only by the tone of the remainder of his appointments but also in how he handles himself once he goes into the oval office. ” Since his stunning election win on 8 November, Trump appears to have relished keeping the pundit class guessing. Each time a pattern appears to be developing in his transition plan, the impulsive   thwarts it with an     manoeuvre or reality   tease. He threw a bone to the Republican party with the appointment of Reince Priebus as chief of staff but simultaneously cheered the   “ ” by naming Steve Bannon of Breitbart News as chief strategist. Yet when white nationalists celebrated at a conference in Washington, even giving Nazi salutes, Trump publicly disavowed them, leading some to accuse him of betrayal. The   gratified hardline conservatives  —   and mortified liberals  —   with a triumvirate of national security appointments: Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, retired army general Mike Flynn as national security adviser and Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director. Sessions has been accused of racist comments  —   he denies any racial prejudice  —   while Flynn tweeted in February: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. ” Asked if Flynn was the right man for the job, Panetta, who knew him at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said: “He could be if he went back to the old Michael Flynn I don’t know if that’s possible. He’s been a little erratic and frankly, in the job of national security adviser, you need somebody who is thoughtful, objective and stable and can allow for different views to be presented to the president. ” But just when it seemed that Trump was rewarding the white men who shouted loudest on his behalf, and deepening the Washington “swamp” that he promised to drain, he switched gear. This week he named Nikki Haley, an Indian American who is governor of South Carolina, as UN ambassador and Betsy DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, as education secretary. Both women had made clear their antipathy toward him during the Republican primary contest in which they supported other candidates DeVos’s ascent was welcomed by Trump’s old foe Jeb Bush. Haley has little by way of foreign policy experience. Ben Carson, who is African American, is tipped for housing and urban development secretary, even though his expertise lies in brain surgery. This week Trump also held talks with representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who endorsed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders in the primaries, and a sprinkling of multimillionaires. Team or rivals or team of  ? The answer is a bit of both so far. A prime example is the speculation around the plum job of secretary of state, which appears to have come down to a straight fight between one of Trump’s most raucous cheerleaders, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, and one of his most ardent critics,   governor Mitt Romney, who previously branded him a “con man” and “phony” but who Trump reportedly believes “looks the part”. All this fits with Trump’s habit of nurturing internal competition in his organisations as well as his role of the showman, the circus master, forever bending the spotlight in his direction with a surprise meeting here or diverting tweet there. In 1990 he told Playboy magazine: “The show is ‘Trump’. And it is   performances everywhere. ” In this he is the polar opposite of the cool, at times professorial, Barack Obama. Tobe Berkovitz, a political media consultant, told the Hill website: “Trump has again demonstrated that all he has to do is send out a tweet and the media will just go crazy  —   and it’s good for at least two news cycles. [He has] a total understanding of what celebrity is, how do you capitalise on celebrity, how do you profit from celebrity. It’s Celebrity Apprentice except now it’s Celebrity President. ” Two Trumps have been on display to the media this week. In a meeting with broadcasting executives and anchors, he reportedly caused outrage with a series of   rants at “liars!” in their ranks. But then, visiting the office of the New York Times, he struck a magnanimous tone. A coherent ideology was elusive, however, as he backpedalled from several assertions forcefully made during the election campaign. Last month, for example, he told election rival Hillary Clinton: “If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. ” To the New York Times, he said this week: “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t   …     It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about. ” Does human activity cause climate change? In March, Trump told the Washington Post: “I am not a great believer in   climate change. ” To the New York Times he said: “I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. ” And in a speech in North Dakota in May, he said: “We’re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement. ” To the New York Times he said: “I have an open mind to it. ” Perhaps one of the most telling   came on the issue of torture. In a speech in South Carolina in February, Trump insisted: “Torture works. OK, folks? You know, I have these guys  —  ‘Torture doesn’t work!’  —   believe me, it works. And waterboarding is your minor form . .. we should go much stronger than waterboarding. ” Then he told the New York Times that retired marine general James Mattis, who is under serious consideration for defence secretary, had told him waterboarding is not such a good idea. “I was surprised  —   he said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer. ” To the  ’s defenders, this could be evidence that he is flexible, pragmatic and willing to change his mind. To his detractors, it suggests that he is like a cushion, bearing the impression of the last person he meets. The New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, noting that Trump veered within hours from slamming the the Gray Lady as a “failing” news organisation to lavishing praise on it as a “world jewel” commented: “There was a lesson here about his desire to be approved of and his hunger to be loved. There was another about the shockingly unformed, pliable nature of the clay that is our     . ” That diagnosis makes the cast of characters surrounding him even more important. So far there has been scant consolation for Democrats, although Mattis does have some admirers. Panetta, who was Pentagon chief under Obama, said: “He knows military issues, he’s very thoughtful about how to use the military and I always found him to be a very good adviser. I certainly have no criticism of him as a military leader. ” Trump is managing to strike a delicate balance, believes George Ajjan, a Republican consultant and strategist. “Trump’s appointments thus far indicate that he wants to reward loyalty and stake out ideological ground on a few issues, but also appear as a magnanimous unifier and avoid reinventing the Washington wheel,” he said. “The transition seems well planned and on track, despite the fact that allegations of nepotism and conflicts of interest will hamper him constantly. ” As for those conflicts of interest involving his business, Trump had an answer this week that echoed Richard Nixon: “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. ” Nixon became the first president to resign while facing impeachment. Trump spent the Thanksgiving holiday at    in Palm Beach, Florida, a luxury estate that was opened in 1927 by one of the richest women in the world, Marjorie Merriweather Post, and donated to the US government in 1973 for use as a winter White House. Trump bought the   property in 1985, opening a private members’ club a portrait of him in a tennis sweater hangs over the bar. The family’s Thanksgiving dinner included stone crabs, oysters, and jumbo shrimp as well as the traditional turkey, stuffing, sweet mashed potatoes and gravy and, for dessert, selections including the tantalising “Three Layer Trump Chocolate Cake”. The businessman could not resist Twitter for an entire day, however, posting: “I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A. C. Company to stay in the U. S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS   Will know soon!” Carrier, a manufacturing company, announced earlier this year that it would move 2, 000 jobs at two of its Indiana plants to Mexico. After his break he was due to return to Trump Tower in New York to continue the shaping his team, which is still essentially an enigma, his presidency still maddeningly hard to predict. Obama is leading optimists who believe the presidency will cut him down to size but others point to evidence that Trump will always be Trump: at 70, he is a man who is used to getting his way and not likely to change. Speaking at the Montclair film festival, tje TV talkshow host and political satirist Stephen Colbert said: “I’m all for give him a chance but don’t give him an inch. I believe everything he said and I remember everything he said. And it’s horrifying. ” He added: “Everyone tried to stop him and they didn’t. He owes them nothing. He goes on a balcony and he says to the crowd, ‘Shall I do it?’ And they say ‘Yes. It shall be so.’ And the balcony is Twitter  —   that’s the balcony for him  —   and that’s what scares me, is that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn’t. He’s a vindictive person. So it’s all going to be fine. ” • This article was amended on 28 November 2016.

192,Simple Minds: how we made Don’t You (Forget About Me),"It was the   and we were on the verge of making it big all over the world, having just released Sparkle in the Rain. However, as with many UK bands, the US was proving tough to crack. Then our record company came to us with an idea. The director John Hughes was making a movie called The Breakfast Club, and they thought it would be a great vehicle for their bands. All this sounded great until they said: “And we’ve got a song for you. ” Being chippy Glaswegians, we said: “What? Nah, we write our own songs. ” But Bruce Findlay, our manager, said: “Look, go and see the movie, just so you’re not being rude. ” A cinema in the West End was hired to show us a rough cut, but we couldn’t give a toss about teenage American schoolkids.  But my wife at the time, Chrissie [Hynde] who was older and wiser, kept badgering me. “I like the song,” she said. “What’s the problem?” Finally, the song’s writer, Keith Forsey, phoned me and rather cleverly said: “I’m a huge fan of the band. How about I just spend a couple of days with you? Maybe we’ll do something in the future. ” We clicked right away, though we did spend rather a lot of time in the pub. Eventually, I started to feel sorry for him. “Maybe we should go into a studio for an afternoon,” I said, “and bang out his tune. ” At that stage, the song was just a demo on a battered cassette, with Keith singing over some keyboards. It didn’t sound like something we would do, but in the bonding session with our new best mate we had a go. I added the big “la,    ” ending because I didn’t have any lyrics. I said I’d write some, but Keith said: “Over my dead body. We’re keeping that. ” By the end, we were sneaking off to our rooms to listen to it. The Breakfast Club came out three months later, and Don’t You (Forget About Me) was released as a single. MTV were all over it, and soon it was at No 2 in the US charts. A week later, I was sitting in the south of France when I got a call telling me we had an American No 1. Eight years earlier, in 1977, I’d asked my dad for £100 so we could start the band. He was a brickie’s labourer and just sat there in his vest, like Rab C Nesbitt, thinking we were nuts. “You mean like the Beatles,” he said, “playing in stadiums?” I said: “Probably. ” When we performed Don’t You (Forget About Me) in Philadelphia for Live Aid in 1985, my dad was down the front. It was the first of many stadiums  —   although he never got the £100 back. We started bonding with Keith the minute we found out he’d been the drummer in the krautrock band Amon Düül II. He couldn’t believe we were into German experimental music. He thought it was some obscure thing nobody knew about, so we told him how all our early stuff was based around the same repetitive, metronomic grooves. Then, when we found out he had played all the electronic drums on the records Giorgio Moroder produced for Donna Summer, including I Feel Love, we just adored him. He had so much energy, he was dancing in the studio. We’d just finished Sparkle in the Rain, the biggest, most bombastic album we’d done. So when it came to Don’t You (Forget About Me) I ramped up the intro with these massive power chords. It was almost a caricature  —   I associated powerchords with American AOR. But it worked. We made a video in a manor house, surrounded by a load of stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes we’d been given. So you’ve got this movie about US   kids, with a song by a band from Glasgow in a manor house in England. It was the thinnest of concepts, but it became huge. At the time, we felt the song didn’t suit us, because we had delusions of being  . When I listen to it now, it’s obviously a brilliant,   pop song. I’m embarrassed we dissed it so much.  • Don’t You (Forget About Me) appears on Simple Minds Acoustic, out now on Caroline International.

193,Donald Trump to remain executive producer of Celebrity Apprentice,"Donald Trump will not give up his role as an executive producer of The Celebrity Apprentice, the reality TV show’s studio said on Thursday, confirming a continuing business entanglement of the   but not its details. Trump’s name will appear in the credits of the show, studio MGM told Variety magazine on Thursday, after the name of show creator Mark Burnett and before that of the program’s new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump hosted the show for more than a decade before his presidential campaign, during which NBC, the network that airs the show, broke ties with him over his claims that Mexican people are “bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists”. A spokeswoman for MGM did not immediately reply to questions about the arrangement. The studio did not disclose to Variety any terms of the deal except that it would pay Trump’s fees, and that NBC would not. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team did not reply to a request for clarification. During a string of meetings last month to interview potential cabinet members of the next White House, Trump met with Ari Emanuel, his agent while he was on The Apprentice and the brother of Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama. Trump gave no details about that meeting, only telling reporters outside a New Jersey golf club that the meeting was “very good. Great guy. Great friend of mine. ” Burnett has denied that he supported Trump’s presidential campaign, and said in October that he and his wife “reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign”. The producer also denied that he suppressed leaked unaired footage or audio from Trump’s time on the show. A former contestant, Summer Zervos, is one of several woman who has accused Trump of kissing and groping her. Trump bragged about being able to grab and kiss women without consent in leaked audio from a 2005 appearance on Access Hollywood, near the peak of his fame from The Apprentice. The   has refused to make a clean break from his sprawling and opaque business interests, instead exploring what legal loopholes could allow his daughter and    Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to play roles of some kind in the government. He reportedly intends to keep a stake in his company, while formally handing control to his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He has so far declined to fully divest from the holdings, as the Office of Government Ethics has advised, and threatens to test the limits of US law on conflicts of interest. During the presidential election, Trump’s campaign falsely said that handing control to his children would serve as a “blind trust”. Since beginning transition work with the Obama administration, Trump has met with Indian business partners, his Washington hotel has courted diplomats, and his potential interests in Taiwan and Argentina come under scrutiny. Breaking with four decades of political tradition, Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, keeping secret the extent of his wealth or potential conflicts of interest in the US and abroad.",donald trump give role execut produc celebr apprentic realiti show studio said thursday confirm continu busi entangl detail trump name appear credit show studio told varieti magazin thursday name show creator mark burnett program host arnold schwarzenegg trump host show decad presidenti campaign network air show broke tie claim mexican peopl bring drug bring crime rapist spokeswoman immedi repli question arrang studio disclos varieti term deal except would trump fee would spokesman trump transit team repli request clarif dure string meet last month interview potenti cabinet member next white hous trump emanuel agent apprentic brother rahm emanuel former white hous chief staff barack obama trump gave detail meet tell report outsid jersey golf club meet good great great friend mine burnett deni support trump presidenti campaign said octob wife reject hatr divis misogyni unfortun part campaign produc also deni suppress leak unair footag audio trump time show former contest summer zervo sever woman accus trump kiss grope trump brag abl grab kiss women without consent leak audio appear access hollywood near peak fame apprentic refus make clean break sprawl opaqu busi interest instead explor legal loophol could allow daughter ivanka trump jare kushner play role kind govern reportedli intend keep stake compani formal hand control adult son eric donald declin fulli divest hold offic govern ethic advis threaten test limit conflict interest dure presidenti elect trump campaign fals said hand control children would serv blind trust sinc begin transit work obama administr trump indian busi partner washington hotel court diplomat potenti interest taiwan argentina come scrutini break four decad polit tradit trump also refus releas return keep secret extent wealth potenti conflict interest abroad
194,Andy Murray beats Nick Kyrgios to reach quarter-final: Wimbledon 2016 – as it happened,"So Murray marches on, winning in under two hours again, clearly determined not to suffer a repeat of his French Open exertions and waste too much energy in the early rounds. He’s into his ninth consecutive Wimbledon   where he’ll face   Tsonga on Wednesday. He beat the Frenchman here in 2010 and 2012 and has won 12 of their 15 meetings. Thanks for reading. That’s all from me today. Bye. Serving for the match, Murray seems to lose concentration, knocking a forehand too long for  .

Murray will have to serve it out. You never know.

Murray flicks a forehand beyond him for   aces for   and holds to love when Kyrgios nets a forehand. The difference today, beyond ability, has been mentality. Kyrgios’s response to losing the first set will only provide his many critics with more ammunition. He’s such a talent but it will lead nowhere if he isn’t willing to put the effort in. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds to 15. Belatedly, some resistance. He doesn’t have much but he does have hope. Third set: Murray*       Kyrgios (*denotes server): John McEnroe is panning Nick Kyrgios on the BBC, criticising him for a “mentally lazy” performance. Murray holds to love. Roger Federer hasn’t dropped a set yet and Murray looks like maintaining his immaculate record as well. “You’d think Kyrgios might have an easier time of it if he weren’t wearing what looks like a week’s worth of shirts at once,” says George Chapman. “Looks very uncomfortable indeed. ” Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds to 30, Murray steering a backhand wide after reaching a drop shot. He’ll be feeling a bit better after that but, well, y’know. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios didn’t bother sitting down during the changeover. He just walked round the net and milled around the baseline. He’s . .. well, he’s a character. If it’s a tactic   and I suspect it isn’t   it’s not going to work. Murray is torturing him. He skips into a   lead, his forehand and backhand clicking beautifully. This is just so good from the world No2 and he holds to love, consolidating the break. This might not be the classic we were hoping for but at least we can bask in a Murray masterclass. Third set: Murray       Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Murray is desperate to get this done in three sets. He charges into a   lead and he’s beginning to chip away at the Kyrgios serve. Kyrgios then flays a forehand wide to give up three break points. Murray can’t take the first, so he takes the third, attacking a second serve before skelping a forehand away. “Come on!” he cries.

He’s a set away from reaching another Wimbledon  . That set lasted 26 minutes. Second set: Murray     Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Whoever wins this match will play   Tsonga in the last eight. The 12th seed led by a break in the first set against his fellow Frenchman, Richard Gasquet, who’s been forced to retire after pulling a back muscle. That’s rotten luck for a player who’s been in fine form this year. As for who’ll face Tsonga, it’s looking like Murray at the moment. Kyrgios is falling apart. He’s rushing everything now, disintegrating, playing three awful points to hand Murray three break points. He saves two of them. He splutters a forehand wide to gift Murray the third, though, and this set is surely done. Kyrgios gestures to his box but there’s only one person deserving of blame here.  Second set: Murray*     Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios rouses himself with a searing backhand down the line for   but it’s   after he knocks another one wide.

Soon he has a   lead, Murray netting a forehand. The Scot’s annoyed with himself and he needs to be careful, with Kyrgios clearly trying to raise his level. Kyrgios lets him off the hook a little, however, doing nothing with a second serve return, allowing Murray to make it   with a forehand. Murray makes it   with a flat forehand that allows him to win the point with a volley but the game goes to deuce after a loose forehand from Murray.

Murray is forced wide  —   but he whips a forehand from right to left and Kyrgios, perhaps not expecting it to come back, clips a forehand volley into the net! Oof. That was a very good first set and it’s gone to the favourite. This is how it went in last year’s US Open. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): The first two points are shared, Kyrgios making it   with a sweet touch at the net. He’s so talented, blessed with skill that can’t be taught.

Another ace is a fine way to hold from   down. First set: Murray*   Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios can only block long off two Murray serves on the first two points. He’s annoyed with himself.

These two are the best of mates off court as well. “It was love at first sight,” Kyrgios says. Nick Kyrgios on Nick Kyrgios: “I’m obviously relaxed, I’m nervous as well. ” He’s not a straightforward guy. Hello. When it’s put to Andy Murray that all that’s left to do is collect the trophy on Sunday now that Novak Djokovic is out, it’s understandable that he pays little attention.

195,Rough trade: the global economy needs a jumpstart to benefit all,"The global economy has expanded greatly since the early 1980s, thanks to technology breakthroughs, the opening of markets and trade being more accessible. Today, trade generates $15tn annually. Nearly $5tn in goods and services flows in and out of the US alone each year. This development has affected people across socioeconomic classes. Former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted in a recent column that the average household income in America is about $10, 000 more than it would have been without this trade progress. And the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped drastically from 1981 to 2010, according to the World Bank. “Trade, with support from aid, has been responsible in the past few decades for the greatest reduction in poverty that society has ever witnessed, by driving economic growth across the globe,” says Peter Harris, Europe region director of sustainability at UPS. “It is therefore essential that we find ways to continue to trade ever more effectively. ” Due in great measure to the Great Recession and moderate economic recovery, the rate of global trade growth has slowed this decade. The World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts that in 2016, it will be less than 3% for the fifth straight year. Factors like climate change, booming populations and cybersecurity concerns have left the future uncertain. Meanwhile, some critics believe that trade agreements such as the proposed   Partnership (TPP) are not fair for everyone. Officials and academics are seeking solutions not only to help businesses, but also for people across the globe. Pros and cons of TPP, Much of the recent conversation about global trade has surrounded the TPP, which is currently awaiting ratification. The TPP covers 12 countries, including the US  —   and with them, approximately 800 million people and 40% of the global economy. Its provisions could bring down existing tax barriers to help increase agriculture, manufacturing and services exports among trading partners. Customs agencies in the TPP countries are also working to improve electronic processing of data and advanced screening of packages. This would help reduce time, cost and complexity in trade. Still, the TPP has become highly politicized. Critics say it goes against the interests of US workers who could potentially lose jobs to companies overseas. Proponents counter that the TPP could help trading partners among member nations to develop global supply chains in which their products are designed, sourced and assembled in many different countries  —   spreading wealth and making global trade more balanced. “The notion that one nation’s success at exporting is another’s failure is no longer true,” says Leslie Griffin, senior vice president of international public policy at UPS. “The   Partnership will create new opportunities for many players and give a needed boost to global trade. ” Bringing nations together, Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, and other academics suggest a way that governments can soothe those who say they’ve been left behind by globalization: provide aid to workers who lose their jobs because of   reasons. Those workers have legitimate concerns and needs. Still, experts like Freund maintain that trade’s benefits are too important to roll back. “There’s always been this misconception out there that trade is a   game, and it’s not,” she says, “As we trade, the pie just gets bigger. Trade makes everyone better off. So, it’s great  —   but it’s not great for everybody all the time. ” Freund notes another major benefit: a balanced global trade ecosystem fosters peace. “Countries that trade a lot tend not to go to war [against each other],” she says. “It’s much easier to get countries to oblige on noneconomic issues when you already have this kind of business community that’s very intertwined. ” For proof, see the relationships between the US and many European nations over the past 70 years. “It’s not hard to argue that in Europe but also in the US, the   War II era has brought peace, wealth and stability,” says Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands who’s also a commissioner with the Global Commission on Internet Governance. “We shouldn’t dismiss what we have built together. ” Level the playing field in the digital age, One major argument is that global trade agreements focus only on helping big businesses. That could change as   continues to evolve, creating an environment in which   and   companies can go global immediately  —   and thus compete    with major corporations.  “This is enabling the ‘entrepreneurial economy’ where large businesses face new competition and where small businesses see huge opportunities,” Griffin says. For the first time in any trade agreement, the TPP includes language focused on helping small and   businesses. It addresses trade barriers that disproportionately challenge small businesses, including opaque customs regulations, complex trade paperwork and slow delivery of small courier shipments. Making trade work for the environment, As the quantity of goods shipped worldwide increases, there’s an urgency to make trade more environmentally friendly. “Trade is essential for global social and economic sustainability, but making these compatible with environmental sustainability is arguably the hardest challenge of all,” says Harris. “We will need dramatic improvements in technology to contain emissions as trade  —   and therefore goods movement  —   expands. ” Take the shift to “slow steaming” of ocean cargo, whereby ships deliberately go slower than their top speeds. This has had “a very significant reduction on carbon emissions,” according to Sean Doherty, head of international trade and investment at the World Economic Forum. Trade agreements and technology will continue to evolve, and there will be even greater attention on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacture and delivery of goods worldwide. Governments and businesses alike will have to ensure these processes are effective as policies and protocols change in the years ahead. “The key responsibility for lawmakers like myself is to look at how we can frame global trade in a   system to ensure standards safeguarding the environment,” Schaake says. “That workers and peoples’ fundamental human rights are strengthened by agreements that provide a frame or embedding for global trade. ” To read more about these issues and see some of the solutions that have emerged, see the 2015 UPS corporate sustainability report.

196,Jamie Shupe becomes first legally non-binary person in the US,"When an Oregon judge declared Jamie Shupe could legally shed the designation of male or female, Shupe felt free. “I have my life back,” Shupe said. “I’m not a male. I’m not a female. ”  Shupe appears to be the first person in the United States who has successfully petitioned for a   gender classification, according to Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal, a New   gay rights organization. “Classic gender markers don’t fit everybody,” Gorenberg said, calling the petition significant for helping people “exist without labels that don’t accurately describe them”. At a recent support group meeting in Portland, where Shupe lives, a young woman tearfully thanked Shupe for broadening the conversation about gender classifications. Shupe, a former army sergeant assigned male at birth and listed as female in discharge papers, told the woman, “I didn’t do this just for myself. ”  Shupe, who prefers the pronoun “they” grew up in southern Maryland, in a family with eight children. Shupe recalls feeling like an outcast, being admonished for acting like a “sissy” and without any role models, struggling to articulate feelings of a gender mismatch. At age 49, retired from the military, married to a woman and raising a daughter, Shupe began to unravel.  “I felt like I was at a breaking point,” Shupe said, “like I was trapped. ”  With a supportive spouse, Shupe moved to a secluded cabin in the woods and began taking hormones.  “I figured I was a transgender woman. My thinking was, well, I’m not a male,” Shupe said. Sandy Shupe said the transition was difficult at times.  “This is the person I’ve spent most of my adult life with,” she said. “We have a child together. I have always said, old age and rocking chairs. That’s still my thought, old age and rocking chairs. When you love someone, you want them to be at peace with themselves. ” Later, Shupe realized the female designation also didn’t feel right.  “No amount of hormones is going to make me look like a female,” Shupe said, taking off a headscarf to reveal a bald head. Shupe doesn’t have plans or the desire to undergo surgery.  “Now, I’m suddenly telling my spouse I’m the same thing she is? It didn’t make sense to me. I didn’t have the intricate knowledge like I do now that I could be other things. ”  Shupe wanted another option, a third classification, and found an ally in Portland lawyer Lake Perriguey.  “I knew the law well enough to know there is no exclusion, it’s not a complicated statute,” Perriguey said. “It’s two lines. People change their names, the process to change your sex identity is the same as changing your name. ”  Perriguey said initially he didn’t realize the historic significance of the case.  “Not being a person of transgender experience, I didn’t realize how confining the legal limit on your gender identity could be,” he said.  Shupe understood there are others with similar struggles and felt compelled to take the case to court, steeling for a    fight.  Instead, the petition was granted swiftly.  Multnomah County circuit court judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted the petition last week, writing: “The sex of Jamie Shupe is hereby changed from female to  . Notice of this legal change shall be posted in a public place in Multnomah County as required by law. ” Shupe’s legal tab was $1, 056.  Now, at 52 years old, Shupe said, the petition “gives me a place to exist”.",when oregon judg declar jami shupe could legal shed design male femal shupe felt free life back shupe said male femal shupe appear first person unit state success petit gender classif accord hayley gorenberg deputi legal director lambda legal right organ classic gender marker everybodi gorenberg said call petit signific help peopl exist without label accur describ recent support group meet portland shupe live young woman tear thank shupe broaden convers gender classif shupe former armi sergeant assign male birth list femal discharg paper told woman shupe prefer pronoun grew southern maryland famili eight children shupe recal feel like outcast admonish act like sissi without role model struggl articul feel gender mismatch retir militari marri woman rais daughter shupe began unravel felt like break point shupe said like trap with support spous shupe move seclud cabin wood began take hormon figur transgend woman think well male shupe said sandi shupe said transit difficult time thi person spent adult life said child togeth alway said rock chair that still thought rock chair when love someon want peac later shupe realiz femal design also feel right amount hormon go make look like femal shupe said take headscarf reveal bald head shupe plan desir undergo surgeri suddenli tell spous thing make sens intric knowledg like could thing shupe want anoth option third classif found alli portland lawyer lake perriguey knew well enough know exclus complic statut perriguey said line peopl chang name process chang ident chang name perriguey said initi realiz histor signific case person transgend experi realiz confin legal limit gender ident could said shupe understood other similar struggl felt compel take case court steel fight instead petit grant swiftli multnomah counti circuit court judg holm hehn grant petit last week write jami shupe herebi chang femal notic legal chang shall post public place multnomah counti requir shupe legal year shupe said petit give place exist
197,Mel and Sue leaving Bake Off: how social media reacted,"First came the revelation that the Great British Bake Off was leaving the BBC for Channel 4.  However, the news that presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc will not be going with it has been particularly hard to swallow for diehard fans  —   if the anguish vented on social media is anything to go by. There was also dismay from former contestants and celebrities. Among them was Richard Burr, who took part in the 2014 series.  Another 2014 contestant, Martha Collison, described the duo as “irreplaceable”. Jo Wheatley, the Bake Off champion in 2011, said she was “really hoping this isn’t true” and that “Mel and Sue are as big a part of GBBO as Mary [Berry] and Paul [Hollywood]”. John Whaite, the winner of the show in 2012, was initially eager to dampen down the gloom. But news of the departure of Giedroyc and Perkins caused a change in his mood. “Mel and Sue jump ship. Very sad news,” he tweeted. “They’re wonderful girls who made the show what it is. Now, I’m not feeling so hopeful . .. ” Perkins and Giedroyc confirmed they would not be fronting Bake Off when it moves to Channel 4 next year, saying in a statement they were “not going with the dough”. They have presented the popular show since 2010 and said they were “shocked and saddened” to learn of the Bake Off’s forthcoming move from the BBC. Amid the inevitable speculation over who will be the new hosts, the   favourite to front the new series is Jo Brand  —   presenter of   show An Extra Slice. The bookmaker William Hill was offering odds of  . Other popular names in the mix include the actor Jennifer Saunders with   odds, the comedian Sarah Millican at   and the comic Ed Byrne at  .",first came revel great british bake leav channel howev news present perkin giedroyc go particularli hard swallow diehard fan anguish vent social media anyth there also dismay former contest celebr among richard burr took part seri anoth contest martha collison describ irreplac wheatley bake champion said realli hope true part gbbo mari berri paul hollywood john whait winner show initi eager dampen gloom news departur giedroyc perkin caus chang mood jump ship veri news tweet they wonder girl made show feel hope perkin giedroyc confirm would front bake move channel next year say statement go dough they present popular show sinc said shock sadden learn bake forthcom move amid inevit specul host favourit front seri brand present show extra slice bookmak william hill offer odd other popular name includ actor jennif saunder odd comedian sarah millican comic byrn
198,Trump’s meeting with congressional Republicans inspires divided response,"Republican opponents of Donald Trump in Congress described meetings with the presumptive GOP nominee as awkward on Thursday and sparred with him, while Trump’s supporters raved about his visit to Capitol Hill. Trump held separate meetings with both the House and Senate caucuses on a sweltering summer day as he tried to continue to unify the GOP behind him. The Republican nominee, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka,    Jared Kushner and chief strategist Paul Manafort, started the day by meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club. Cable news pundit Larry Kudlow introduced Trump, who also joked and exchanged hugs with Paul Ryan, although the speaker has long been unenthusiastic about the real estate developer’s candidacy. Some House members left the private meetings giving a highly positive account of Trump’s comments. Ralph Abraham of Louisiana said his party’s nominee talked about “growth, security and prosperity, all the good things” while fellow Louisiana congressman and Senate candidate John Fleming said there was “a lot of positive energy” and “the entire conference was uniting behind Donald Trump”. In his remarks, Trump reportedly addressed a number of policy issues while also harping on what he felt was unfair media criticism over his praise for Saddam Hussein killing terrorists in recent days. His grievances were shared by many in the room. Trent Franks of Arizona, a   “former critic” of Trump, complained to reporters afterwards: “You missed all the ugly things he said about Saddam Hussein but if he says he [Saddam] kills terrorists he’s in love with Saddam Hussein. Of all the stupidity and misappropriation of the truth. ”  Although Trump received multiple standing ovations, he may not have been the most popular member of his family in the room. When Peter King of New York said members had their choice who to take a picture with, they flocked towards Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. “She’s the star,” King said. But there were also critics in the room. Mark Sanford of South Carolina mocked Trump afterward for referencing article XII of the US constitution in response to a question about article I, which delineates Congress’s powers. There are only seven articles in the constitution. Other longtime Trump detractors were left unimpressed, too. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Iraq war veteran, grimaced at Trump’s unprompted mention of the Saddam controversy. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania rolled his eyes in describing Trump to reporters. “He complained about the media, shocking,” said Dent. Dent also noted that Trump proclaimed: “Hispanics love him. ” Dent noted that this statement was not borne out in any polls. In a meeting afterwards with senators only a few blocks away, things got more heated. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has pointedly refused to endorse Trump, reportedly confronted the Republican nominee. Flake noted that he was the Arizona senator who wasn’t captured, a reference to Trump’s disparaging remarks last year about John McCain, and Trump responded by predicting Flake would fail to win  . Mark Kirk of Illinois, who has withdrawn his endorsement of the nominee, later told reporters: “I think Trump will get a vote like Alan Keyes got in Illinois, around 28%,” a reference to the sacrificial lamb candidate who ran for the Senate against Barack Obama in 2004. Other Republicans tried to play down the exchanges between Flake and Trump. John Thune of South Dakota told reporters that they were simply the kind of “frank exchange you have inside the family” while Thom Tillis of North Carolina insisted that this was “a perfectly appropriate discussion” that only made up a few minutes of a longer meeting. Yet despite those conflicts, many senators enthused about the meeting. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a longtime supporter of Trump, said “there were a massive number of converts” after the meeting. After the gathering, Trump held a    meeting with primary rival Ted Cruz and asked the Texas senator to speak at the convention. Cruz, who has yet to endorse him, agreed.  Others attending praised Trump’s policy chops. Tim Scott of South Carolina thought the discussion was “meaty” and there was “a lot of policy” while senator Bob Corker of Tennessee noted that Trump showed “there’s a lot more nuance to his positions than people realized”. However, there was a tendency for the presumptive nominee to ramble, as Sen Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma noted: “You’ve watched him he talked about every issue. ” Yet all that policy detail still didn’t woo the most diehard   member of the Senate. Ben Sasse has long been vocal about his opposition to Trump and in a statement, a spokesman for the Nebraska senator said: “Senator Sasse went to today’s meeting ready to listen. Senator Sasse introduced himself to Mr Trump and the two had a gracious exchange. Mr Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. Nothing has changed. ”",republican oppon donald trump congress describ meet presumpt nomine awkward thursday spar trump support rave visit capitol hill trump held separ meet hous senat caucus swelter summer tri continu unifi behind republican nomine accompani daughter ivanka jare kushner chief strategist paul manafort start meet hous republican capitol hill club cabl news pundit larri kudlow introduc trump also joke exchang hug paul ryan although speaker long unenthusiast real estat develop candidaci some hous member left privat meet give highli posit account trump comment ralph abraham louisiana said parti nomine talk growth secur prosper good thing fellow louisiana congressman senat candid john fleme said posit energi entir confer unit behind donald trump remark trump reportedli address number polici issu also harp felt unfair media critic prais saddam hussein kill terrorist recent day grievanc share mani room trent frank arizona former critic trump complain report afterward miss ugli thing said saddam hussein say saddam kill terrorist love saddam hussein stupid misappropri truth although trump receiv multipl stand ovat popular member famili room when peter king york said member choic take pictur flock toward trump daughter ivanka star king said also critic room mark sanford south carolina mock trump afterward referenc articl constitut respons question articl delin congress power there seven articl constitut other longtim trump detractor left unimpress adam kinzing illinoi iraq veteran grimac trump unprompt mention saddam controversi charli dent pennsylvania roll eye describ trump report complain media shock said dent dent also note trump proclaim hispan love dent note statement born poll meet afterward senat block away thing heat jeff flake arizona pointedli refus endors trump reportedli confront republican nomine flake note arizona senat captur refer trump disparag remark last year john mccain trump respond predict flake would fail mark kirk illinoi withdrawn endors nomine later told report think trump vote like alan key illinoi around refer sacrifici lamb candid senat barack obama other republican tri play exchang flake trump john thune south dakota told report simpli kind frank exchang insid famili thom tilli north carolina insist perfectli appropri discuss made minut longer meet despit conflict mani senat enthus meet jeff session alabama longtim support trump said massiv number convert meet after gather trump held meet primari rival cruz ask texa senat speak convent cruz endors agre other attend prais trump polici chop scott south carolina thought discuss meati polici senat corker tennesse note trump show nuanc posit peopl realiz howev tendenc presumpt nomine rambl inhof oklahoma note watch talk everi issu polici detail still diehard member senat sass long vocal opposit trump statement spokesman nebraska senat said senat sass went today meet readi listen senat sass introduc trump graciou exchang sass continu believ countri place candid elect remain dumpster fire noth chang
199,Careless whisker: Universal to release album for cats,"They are a particularly tough audience  —   picky, moody, often impossible to please  —   but cats represent an untapped music market, according to one of the world’s biggest record labels. Universal Music has announced it will be the first major label to release an album that is not for human consumption  —   although, until cats get bank accounts, humans will have to pay for it. David Teie, an American cellist and music researcher based at the University of Maryland, has created Music for Cats, saying it is an “absolutely serious” undertaking . He said: “It is the biggest challenge with this, people think it is silly. But I think it is the way the brain works . If I look at a door and say that’s a fish, you are going to say that’s a door . Everybody knows what music is  —   and animals are not included. If you really look into it, what’s silly is the idea that only one species could have music available for it. ” The music features purring and suckling noises, as well as Teie on his cello accompanied by players from the US National Symphony Orchestra. It is aimed at calming and bringing pleasure to cats, rather than getting them excited. Teie produced the album after first studying whether music could be created for   tamarin monkeys. Those experiments were so successful that he decided to widen them. “There are not very many   tamarin owners out there so we decided if we were to go out and spread the word, spread the music, we should go with a species we hang around with a lot,” he said, Dogs were ruled out because there are so many variations in the breeds. “I was worried about having to write terrier music and labrador music and so on  —   it would have slowed things up,” Teie said. So cats were chosen and it has proved successful, with studies showing the recordings are most effective for cats who can be neurotic or nervous or may have been abused in the past. Wary cat owners who couldn’t recall their pet ever enjoying or reacting to music should be aware they were playing them the wrong melodies, said Teie. “There have been many studies done and they basically all came up dry because animals don’t give two hoots about our music and they really shouldn’t,” he said. The original music for cats was   after a whirlwind Kickstarter campaign quickly attracted pledges of nearly $250, 000. That caught the eye of Universal, which promptly signed Teie up. Teie admitted he had gone through emotions familiar to many musicians ploughing an independent furrow. “I was very excited about it at first, then not excited about it . .. was I signing my life away to somebody else? Now that it is all done I’m very excited again,” he said. The album will be released in all territories on 28 October, and given that there are 9. 2 million cats in the UK alone, Universal believes there is an enormous untapped market. A spokesperson said the label was “thrilled to be part of this   project” and predicted “Music For” albums could follow for dogs and horses. Teie said he hoped that the more animal music became available, the more it would be accepted. “I am hoping that in a hundred years from now people will have to be taught that music was once only for humans,” he said. If that happens then people may remember Teie as the true pioneer. But his research has not always been easy. “As a matter of fact I’m allergic to cats,” he said. “I’ve grown from being an admirer to a genuine cat lover now, but I’m still allergic. ”",they particularli tough audienc picki moodi often imposs pleas cat repres untap music market accord world biggest record label univers music announc first major label releas album human consumpt although cat bank account human david teie american cellist music research base univers maryland creat music cat say absolut seriou undertak said biggest challeng peopl think silli think brain work look door fish go door everybodi know music anim includ realli look silli idea speci could music avail music featur pur suckl nois well teie cello accompani player nation symphoni orchestra aim calm bring pleasur cat rather get excit teie produc album first studi whether music could creat tamarin monkey those experi success decid widen there mani tamarin owner decid spread word spread music speci hang around said dog rule mani variat breed worri write terrier music labrador music would slow thing teie said cat chosen prove success studi show record effect cat neurot nervou abus past wari owner recal ever enjoy react music awar play wrong melodi said teie there mani studi done basic came anim give hoot music realli said origin music cat whirlwind kickstart campaign quickli attract pledg nearli that caught univers promptli sign teie teie admit gone emot familiar mani musician plough independ furrow excit first excit sign life away somebodi els done excit said album releas territori octob given million cat alon univers believ enorm untap market spokesperson said label thrill part project predict music album could follow dog hors teie said hope anim music becam avail would accept hope hundr year peopl taught music human said happen peopl rememb teie true pioneer research alway easi matter fact allerg cat said grown admir genuin lover still allerg
